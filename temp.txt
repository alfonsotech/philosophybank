p.m. for the next month. It’s a depressing time for all but the most dedicated winter lovers, and for some people, the seasonal change can have real, concrete mental health consequences. Researchers estimate that roughly 6 percent of the U.S. population has <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20364651" data-href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20364651" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">seasonal affective disorder</a> (SAD).</p><p name="1288" id="1288" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">SAD is a form of seasonal depression that typically hits during the darkest time of the year, beginning in fall and lasting through spring (though it is possible, but less likely, to experience SAD in summer). People with the condition have many of the common symptoms of depression: low energy, loss of interest in daily activities, increase or decrease in appetite, trouble concentrating, sleep issues.</p><p name="9169" id="9169" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To treat it, health care professionals usually recommend some combination of medication, psychotherapy, and <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/seasonal-affective-disorder/index.shtml#part_152433" data-href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/seasonal-affective-disorder/index.shtml#part_152433" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">light therapy</a>, where patients bask in the beams of a light box. (Psychiatrist Norman Rosenthal, who was the first to formally describe SAD, in 1984, also advises surrounding yourself with as much natural light as possible while inside: “Take one room in your house and paint the walls and ceiling white for maximum reflectance of light,” he says. “Or find an indoor pool in a space that has large windows, which allow the sun to shine in and cast shimmering reflections on the surrounding walls.”) To make it through the winter, though, some people with SAD have found additional, more creative ways to combat their symptoms. Here, nine people with the condition share how they cope.</p><h3 name="a44a" id="a44a" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Get Outside</h3><p name="0194" id="0194" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--h3">“Probably eight years ago, I started getting panicky in September that we were losing daylight and winter was on the way. I’m a very active cyclist, and riding outside in the daylight keeps me sane. Unless it’s brutally cold, I start every day with a one-to-two-mile dog walk. [I tell myself,] ‘You’re going to feel great once you’re outside!’ I also get on my mountain or road bike whenever possible.”</p><p name="1190" id="1190" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Patty Woodworth, 54, owner of </em><a href="https://www.actionwheels.com/" data-href="https://www.actionwheels.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Action Wheels</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> bike shop, Mantua, New Jersey</em></p><p name="2b37" id="2b37" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I started doing the opposite of hibernating. I basically use the fall and winter to train for a spring tennis league. Last year, I hiked across Utah in January. It’s hard to be depressed when you just hiked 15 miles. The year before, I did Mount LeConte in the Smoky Mountains. I start hitting the gym more, eating better, yoga. Just focusing on getting in shape and physical exertion takes my mind off the darkness. Then, in summer, I can sit in the air conditioning and play video games.”</p><p name="eced" id="eced" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">William Bender, 38, journalist, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</em></p><h3 name="324c" id="324c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Take a&nbsp;Trip</h3><p name="193f" id="193f" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--h3">“I [was] born and raised in Iceland, where we have daylight 24 hours in the summer and dark [for a] big part of the day in the wintertime. Some towns in Iceland don’t get sunlight in the wintertime because of the mountains that block the sun. Icelanders are known to go to other countries in the winter because they can’t handle the darkness. Usually, when we haven’t seen the sun for days, you can tell how the mood swings in people. We call it <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">það er þungt yfir fólki</em>, which means that people have a heavy cloud over them. Those who can’t afford [travel] find it useful to go to the gym, go out to meet people, or stay at home and light candles. When the sun shows her face in the wintertime, many use it to go outdoor swimming, skiing, hiking, or to take long walks, for example. Also we find it very useful to do some exercise, especially outdoors.”</p><p name="b133" id="b133" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Jóhanna Gudjonsdottir, 40, social worker, Reykjavík, Iceland</em></p><h3 name="cfd4" id="cfd4" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Care for Something</h3><p name="e144" id="e144" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--h3">“Right before daylight saving time last year, I had budgeted to go to a fancy succulent store, and I ended up buying 15 plants — some hardy succulents, which are really difficult to kill, [and] cacti. I push them all up next to the door a couple days a week so they’re getting direct sunlight. I have a bunch next to my bed, I have a bunch on my coffee table, and I have a balcony. Other than my partner, they are the first thing I see when I wake up. I’ll take a weekend to make sure they’re watered and let them onto the balcony so they can get some sunlight and bring them back in. If I need to transfer them from one pot to another, I’ll do that.

I went to see it a bunch of times, memorized a lot of the songs, read voraciously about the composers and the actors — and the intensity of my obsession propelled me through the winter, giving me something to feel excited about when my depression typically would’ve sapped me of the ability to feel pleasure about anything. In subsequent years, it’s taken different forms: One year, I was coaching a high school improv team, and I got really into planning the best possible exercises and practices for them and watching them compete in the Canadian Improv Games. Other years, I’ve cultivated crushes on swoon-worthy celebrities or gotten really into some hobby, like poetry or art. Most recently, I met my current partner last December, and the early days of us flirting and falling in love were so intense and heady that I almost didn’t notice my seasonal depression last year.”</p><p name="0003" id="0003" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Kate Sloan, 26, freelance writer, Toronto, Ontario</em></p><p name="18ae" id="18ae" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Downtime started to become my enemy.

I found a couple Rebel and Stormtrooper army men at a hobby shop and started there. Over time, they’ve gotten more elaborate, and they have been something that I look forward to coming home to.

As a music writer, I was extremely fortunate to be in a position where I was able to attend almost any show I wanted in exchange for coverage, so I started going to as many shows as possible. I found this method proved to be extremely helpful, as I was watching bands that I enjoy, forcing myself to be social, and finding new spaces that made me happy when the bone-chilling environment just wasn’t cutting it anymore.”</p><p name="15f8" id="15f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">— <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Zac Gelfand, 22, music journalist, New York City</em></p><h3 name="4e33" id="4e33" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Get Creative With Your Light&nbsp;Sources</h3><p name="9716" id="9716" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I’m an acupuncturist and a hypnotherapist.

The light, it’s so radiant and bright, even when you’re wearing the goggles.

Some towns in Iceland don’t get sunlight in the wintertime because of the mountains that block the sun. Icelanders are known to go to other countries in the winter because they can’t handle the darkness. Usually, when we haven’t seen the sun for days, you can tell how the mood swings in people. We call it það er þungt yfir fólki, which means that people have a heavy cloud over them.

country, daylight won’t last beyond 5 p.m. for the next month. It’s a depressing time for all but the most dedicated winter lovers, and for some people, the seasonal change can have real, concrete mental health consequences. Researchers estimate that roughly 6 percent of the U.S. population has \x3ca href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20364651\" data-href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20364651\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\x3eseasonal affective disorder\x3c/a\x3e (SAD).\x3c/p\x3e\x3cp name=\"1288\" id=\"1288\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\x3eSAD is a form of seasonal depression that typically hits during the darkest time of the year, beginning in fall and lasting through spring (though it is possible, but less likely, to experience SAD in summer). People with the condition have many of the common symptoms of depression: low energy, loss of interest in daily activities, increase or decrease in appetite, trouble concentrating, sleep issues.\x3c/p\x3e\x3cp name=\"9169\" id=\"9169\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\x3eTo treat it, health care professionals usually recommend some combination of medication, psychotherapy, and \x3ca href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/seasonal-affective-disorder/index.shtml#part_152433\" data-href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/seasonal-affective-disorder/index.shtml#part_152433\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\x3elight therapy\x3c/a\x3e, where patients bask in the beams of a light box. (Psychiatrist Norman Rosenthal, who was the first to formally describe SAD, in 1984, also advises surrounding yourself with as much natural light as possible while inside: “Take one room in your house and paint the walls and ceiling white for maximum reflectance of light,” he says. “Or find an indoor pool in a space that has large windows, which allow the sun to shine in and cast shimmering reflections on the surrounding walls.”) To make it through the winter, though, some people with SAD have found additional, more creative ways to combat their symptoms.
