particular. In the summer of 1979, Elizabeth Anderson, then a rising junior at Swarthmore College, got a job as a bookkeeper at a bank in Harvard Square. Every morning, she and the other bookkeepers would process a large stack of bounced checks. Businesses usually had two accounts, one for payroll and the other for costs and supplies. When companies were short of funds, Anderson noticed, they would always bounce their payroll checks. It made a cynical kind of sense: a worker who was owed money wouldn’t go anywhere, or could be replaced, while an unpaid supplier would stop supplying. Still, Anderson found it disturbing that businesses would write employees phony checks, burdening them with bounce fees. It appeared to happen all the time.</p><p>Midway through summer, the bank changed its office plan. When Anderson had started, the bookkeepers worked in rows of desks. Coördination was easy—a check that fell under someone else’s purview could be handed down the line—and there was conversation throughout the day. Then cubicles were added. That transformation interrupted the workflow, the conversational flow, and most other things about the bookkeepers’ days. Their capacities as workers were affected, yet the change had come down from on high.</p><p>These problems nagged at Anderson that summer and beyond. She had arrived at college as a libertarian who wanted to study economics. In the spirit of liberal-arts exploration, though, she enrolled in an introductory philosophy course whose reading list included Karl Marx’s 1844 manuscripts concerning worker alienation. Anderson thought that Marx’s economic arguments about the declining rate of profit and the labor theory of value fell apart under scrutiny. But she was stirred by his observational writings about the experience of work. Her summer at the bank drove home the fact that systemic behavior <em class="">inside</em> the workplace was part of the socioeconomic fabric, too: it mattered whether you were the person who got a clear check or a bounced check, whether a hierarchy made it easier or harder for you to excel and advance. Yet economists had no way of factoring those influences into their thinking. As far as they were concerned, a job was a contract—an exchange of labor for money—and if you were unhappy you left. The nature of the workplace, where most people spent half their lives, was a black box.</p><p>Anderson grew intellectually restless. Other ideas that were presented as cornerstones of economics, such as rational-choice theory, didn’t match the range of human behaviors that she was seeing in the wild. She liked how philosophy approached big problems that cut across various fields, but she was most excited by methods that she encountered in the history and the philosophy of science. Like philosophers, scientists chased Truth, but their theories were understood to be provisional—tools for resolving problems as they appeared, models valuable only to the extent that they explained and predicted what showed in experiments. A Newtonian model of motion had worked beautifully for a long time, but then people noticed bits of unaccountable data, and relativity emerged as a stronger theory. Couldn’t disciplines like philosophy work that way, too?</p><p>The bank experience showed how you could be oppressed by hierarchy, working in an environment where you were neither free nor equal. But this implied that freedom and equality were bound together in some way beyond the basic state of being unenslaved, which was an unorthodox notion. Much social thought is rooted in the idea of a conflict between the two. If individuals exercise freedoms, conservatives like to say, some inequalities will naturally result. Those on the left basically agree—and thus allow constraints on personal freedom in order to reduce inequality. The philosopher Isaiah Berlin called the opposition between equality and freedom an “intrinsic, irremovable element in human life.” It is our fate as a society, he believed, to haggle toward a balance between them.</p><p>In this respect, it might seem odd that, through history, equality and freedom have arrived together as ideals. What if they weren’t opposed, Anderson wondered, but, like the sugar-phosphate chains in DNA, interlaced in a structure that we might not yet understand? What if the way most of us think about the relation between equality and freedom—the very basis for the polarized, intractable political division of this moment—is wrong?</p><p>At fifty-nine, Anderson is the chair of the University of Michigan’s department of philosophy and a champion of the view that equality and freedom are mutually dependent, enmeshed in changing conditions through time. Working at the intersection of moral and political philosophy, social science, and economics, she has become a leading theorist of democracy and social justice. She has built a case, elaborated across decades, that equality is the basis for a free society. Her work, drawing on real-world problems and information, has helped to redefine the way contemporary philosophy is done, leading what might be called the Michigan school of thought. Because she brings together ideas from both the left and the right to battle increasing inequality, Anderson may be the philosopher best suited to this awkward moment in American life. She builds a democratic frame for a society in which people come from different places and are predisposed to disagree.</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>One recent autumn morning, Anderson flew from Ann Arbor, where she lives, to Columbus, to deliver a lecture at Ohio State University.<span data-page="page_2"></span> With a bit of time before her talk, she sat in a high-backed chair and spoke with undergraduates about her work. “Almost everyone wants to be respected and esteemed by others, so how can you make that compatible with a society of equals?” she asked. The students, looking a touch wary, listened intently and stared.</p><p>People who meet Anderson in the world often find that she is more approachable than they imagined an august philosopher to be. She is, she’d be the first to say, a klutz. Most days, she wears a colorful cotton blouse, hiking sneakers, and hard-wearing khakis that could bear a carabiner full of keys. “Liz doesn’t put on airs,” her friend Rebecca Eisenberg, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School, says. Dan Troyka, another friend, says, “She could be at a potluck as easily as at a philosophy symposium.” She talks on a dais the way she does to buddies over lunch—in a trumpety voice, flattened across mid-American vowels—and has only a nodding acquaintance with many decorums. A few friends felt unsettled when she was interviewed on cable news earlier this year; it was the first time they had ever seen her wearing makeup.</p><p>In Ohio, she wore a loose black dress, trimmed in hot pink, over billowing pants and black flats. (“Feminists work to overcome the internal obstacles to choice—self-abnegation, lack of confidence, and low self-esteem—that women often face from internalizing norms of femininity,” Anderson, who holds a joint professorship in women’s studies, has written.) She crossed her right leg over her left and blinked as students formulated questions. She takes great pleasure in arranging information in useful forms; if she weren’t a philosopher, she thinks, she’d like to be a mapmaker, or a curator of archeological displays in museums.</p><p>As the students listened, she sketched out the entry-level idea that one basic way to expand equality is by expanding the range of valued fields within a society. Unlike a hardscrabble peasant community of yore in which the only skill that anyone cared about might be agricultural prowess, a society with many valued arenas lets individuals who are good at art or storytelling or sports or making people laugh receive a bit of love.</p><p>“Is the idea that we expand the number of values so that everyone gets a piece of the scene?” a young woman asked. She was trying to understand how hierarchies of esteem could be compatible with equality. “Or is there some sort of respectable limit, so we’re, like, We’ve sort of found the things we value, and you’ve got to aim for one of them!”</p><p>Anderson replied with a bright cackle of delight: <em class="">Hah-hah-hah!</em> Friends have noted that her laughter, like the autumn weather, comes in warm and chilly forms. There’s a staccato laugh of encouraging good humor (<em class="">Hah!</em>). There is, more ominously, a rough, guttural chuckle of declining barometric pressure (<em class="">Hhhh-aahr-aahr-aahr</em>), with which she introduces ideas she considers comically, dangerously bad. Addressing the student’s question, she posited endless innovation within general values. “Like, every society has music, and great musical performers always get esteem,” she said, extending her forearms in a teddy-bear position of embrace.</p><p>In general, Anderson is outgoing when conversation turns to ideas and shy about other things. (“If you want to make her totally uncomfortable, tell her she has to go to a fancy function in a cocktail dress,” her husband says.) Now she cleared her throat noisily. “If you look back at the origins of liberalism, it starts first with a certain settlement about religious difference,” she said. “Catholics, Protestants—they’re killing each other! Finally, Germany, England, all these places say, We’re tired of these people killing each other, so we’re going to make a peace settlement: religious toleration, live and let live.”</p><p>She spread her hands wider. “Then something remarkable happens,” she said. “People now have the freedom to have crosscutting identities in different domains. At church, I’m one thing. At work, I’m something else. I’m something else at home, or with my friends. The ability not to have an identity that one carries from sphere to sphere but, rather, to be able to slip in and adopt whatever values and norms are appropriate while retaining one’s identities in other domains?” She paused. “That <em class="">is</em> what it is to be free.”</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>A few years after her summer at the bank, Anderson was back in Cambridge, as a Harvard graduate student, studying political and moral philosophy under the mentorship of John Rawls. At a dinner party one evening, she was introduced to a former philosophy undergraduate named David Jacobi. He was smart, winsomely geeky, and uncommonly kind, and he had a thing for brainy women. They began dating. Jacobi wound up in medical school. Anderson wound up teaching at Michigan. She was touched when he requested a hospital near her, in Detroit, for his internship. Sometime after that, they got married, though neither recalls exactly when. They looked for a place to live near Jacobi’s job, and their criteria were simple: price, neighborhood, and space.</p><div class="Callout__inset-left___2rZjf" data-type="callout" data-callout="inset-left"><div class="CartoonEmbed__container___vf5AM "><a class="Link__link___3dWao CartoonEmbed__captionLink___14pNW " href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a22442-rd"><figure class="Figure__figure___U_9Te  "><div class="placeholder"><div class="placeholder-buttress"></div><div class="placeholder-content"><div class="Image__image___1PhYl" role="button" tabindex="0"><picture class="component-responsive-image"><source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5c1d1d1bd2db9849ec9e440e/master/w_280,c_limit/190107_a22442_rd.jpg, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5c1d1d1bd2db9849ec9e440e/master/w_560,c_limit/190107_a22442_rd.jpg 2x"><source srcset="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5c1d1d1bd2db9849ec9e440e/master/w_727,c_limit/190107_a22442_rd.jpg, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5c1d1d1bd2db9849ec9e440e/master/w_1454,c_limit/190107_a22442_rd.jpg 2x"><img alt="" src="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5c1d1d1bd2db9849ec9e440e/master/w_727,c_limit/190107_a22442_rd.jpg" title=""></picture></div></div></div></figure></a><div class="CartoonEmbed__socialWrapper___3-ICo"><div class="SocialShare__socialShare___92Ene SocialShare__grey___dItUm CartoonEmbed__socialShare___13L3P"><a class="Link__link___3dWao SocialShare__link___Sad7k SocialShare__facebook___Jm71k " rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" data-track-type="socialShare" data-track-location="cartoon" data-source="facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa22442-rd&amp;display=popup&amp;ref=plugin"></a><a class="Link__link___3dWao SocialShare__link___Sad7k SocialShare__twitter___3O6QA " rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" data-track-type="socialShare" data-track-location="cartoon" data-source="twitter" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa22442-rd&amp;text=A%20New%20Yorker%20Cartoon&amp;tw_p=tweetbutton&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa22442-rd"></a><a class="Link__link___3dWao SocialShare__link___Sad7k SocialShare__email___TlCif " rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" data-track-type="socialShare" data-track-location="cartoon" data-source="email" href="mailto:?subject=From%20newyorker.com:%20A%20New%20Yorker%20Cartoon&amp;body=%0D%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa22442-rd"></a><a class="Link__link___3dWao CartoonEmbed__shop___1TDi0 " rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" data-track-type="shop" data-track-location="cartoon-shop" href="https://condenaststore.com/conde-nast-brand/cartoonbank"></a></div></div></div></div><p>As Anderson toured apartments, though, she noticed other forces in play. Greater Detroit was effectively segregated by race. Oak Park had middle-class white sections and middle-class black sections. In Southfield, a real-estate agent told her not to worry, because locals were “holding the line against blacks at 10 Mile Road.” Until then, Anderson had not<span data-page="page_3"></span> thought seriously about race; she assumed that reasonable people treated it as undefining. Now she felt herself being swept, as a middle-class white woman, into a particular zone. To the extent that it constrained her options, it felt like an impingement on freedom. To the extent that it entrenched racial hierarchy, it seemed anti-egalitarian as well.</p><p>As a rule, it’s easy to complain about inequality, hard to settle on the type of equality we want. Do we want things to be equal where we start in life or where we land? When inequalities arise, what are the knobs that we adjust to get things back on track? Individually, people are unequal in countless ways, and together they join groups that resist blending. How do you build up a society that allows for such variety without, as in the greater-Detroit real-estate market, turning difference into a constraint? How do you move from a basic model of egalitarian variety, in which everybody gets a crack at being a star at something, to figuring out how to respond to a complex one, where people, with different allotments of talent and virtue, get unequal starts, and often meet with different constraints along the way?</p><p>In 1999, Anderson published an article in the journal <em class="">Ethics</em>, titled “What Is the Point of Equality?,” laying out the argument for which she is best known. “If much recent academic work defending equality had been secretly penned by conservatives,” she began, opening a grenade in the home trenches, “could the results be any more embarrassing for egalitarians?”</p><p>The problem, she proposed, was that contemporary egalitarian thinkers had grown fixated on distribution: moving resources from lucky-seeming people to unlucky-seeming people, as if trying to spread the luck around. This was a weird and nebulous endeavor. Is an heir who puts his assets into a house in a flood zone and loses it unlucky—or lucky and dumb? Or consider a woman who marries rich, has children, and stays at home to rear them (crucial work for which she gets no wages). If she leaves the marriage to escape domestic abuse and subsequently struggles to support her kids, is that bad luck or an accretion of bad choices? Egalitarians should agree about clear cases of blameless misfortune: the quadriplegic child, the cognitively impaired adult, the teen-ager born into poverty with junkie parents. But Anderson balked there, too. By categorizing people as lucky or unlucky, she argued, these egalitarians set up a moralizing hierarchy. In the article, she imagined some citizens getting a state check and a bureaucratic letter:</p><blockquote><p>To the disabled: Your defective native endowments or current disabilities, alas, make your life less worth living than the lives of normal people.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. To the stupid and untalented: Unfortunately, other people don’t value what little you have to offer in the system of production.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Because of the misfortune that you were born so poorly endowed with talents, we productive ones will make it up to you: we’ll let you share in the bounty of what we have produced with our vastly superior and highly valued abilities.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. To the ugly and socially awkward:&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Maybe you won’t be such a loser in love once potential dates see how rich you are.</p></blockquote><p>By letting the lucky class go on reaping the market’s chancy rewards while asking others to concede inferior status in order to receive a drip-drip-drip of redistributive aid, these egalitarians were actually entrenching people’s status as superior or subordinate. Generations of bleeding-heart theorists had been doing the wolf’s work in shepherds’ dress.</p><p>In Anderson’s view, the way forward was to shift from distributive equality to what she called relational, or democratic, equality: meeting as equals, regardless of where you were coming from or going to. This was, at heart, an exercise of freedom. The trouble was that many people, picking up on libertarian misconceptions, thought of freedom only in the frame of their own actions. If one person’s supposed freedom results in someone else’s subjugation, that is not actually a free society in action. It’s hierarchy in disguise.</p><p>To be truly free, in Anderson’s assessment, members of a society had to be able to function as human beings (requiring food, shelter, medical care), to participate in production (education, fair-value pay, entrepreneurial opportunity), to execute their role as citizens (freedom to speak and to vote), and to move through civil society (parks, restaurants, workplaces, markets, and all the rest). Egalitarians should focus policy attention on areas where that order had broken down. Being homeless was an unfree condition by all counts; thus, it was incumbent on a free society to remedy that problem. A quadriplegic adult was blocked from civil society if buildings weren’t required to have ramps. Anderson’s democratic model shifted the remit of egalitarianism from the idea of equalizing wealth to the idea that people should be equally free, regardless of their differences. A society in which everyone had the same material benefits could still be unequal, in this crucial sense; democratic equality, being predicated on equal respect, wasn’t something you could simply tax into existence. “People, not nature, are responsible for turning the natural diversity of human beings into oppressive hierarchies,” Anderson wrote.</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>Anderson was born early, at three pounds six ounces, and stayed small through childhood, wearing toddler-size clothes into the second grade. “People tended to treat her<span data-page="page_4"></span> as much younger than her real age and ability,” her mother, Eve, says. For years, she scarcely spoke; she had a lisp and seemed loath to reveal the imperfection. Eve recalls passing her bedroom and hearing her practicing her name repeatedly, <em class="">E-liz-a-beth,</em> trying to get it right. When she was three, her mother asked, “Why do you allow your brother to talk for you?”—why didn’t she speak for herself?</p><p>“Until now, it simply was not necessary,” Elizabeth said. It was the first full sentence that she had ever uttered.</p><p>Their household, in Manchester, Connecticut, was mixed and fluid. Eve, a freelance journalist, was Jewish; Anderson’s father, Olof, an aeronautical engineer, had been brought up Swedish Lutheran. They helped found a local Unitarian Universalist worship space. Eve volunteered at the local Democratic Party headquarters and had campaigned for Adlai Stevenson; in 1964, Olof was elected to a Democratic seat on the Manchester board of directors. “They were throwing fund-raising parties all the time,” Anderson recalls. She, in contrast, felt awkward and anxious. “Books were secure—this was something I could master and control.”</p><p>The reading led to other interests. “Everyone had something to teach her,” Laura Grande, a childhood friend, says. “She wasn’t interested in parties, or in social gatherings that weren’t enlightening.” Anderson dreamed of studying math and economics, because she loved the way they hung together in a tight system. At one point, Olof and Elizabeth read Plato’s Republic and Mill’s “On Liberty” together. The world outside seemed untidy; she found peace in the stability of shared ideas.</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>One Friday afternoon, Anderson sat with Kimberly Chuang, a soft-spoken twenty-nine-year-old who had just defended her dissertation, the final rite of passage before the Ph.D. Chuang had devised a model for “contributive justice,” determining what people owe society, rather than what society owes them: a frameshift with implications for taxation. At the defense, five professors prodded her with questions in the manner of a dental scaler scraping away plaque—an excavation that Chuang seemed to enjoy in proportion. They deliberated, then issued good news. “You’re a doctor!” Anderson said. Everybody stood up and applauded.</p><p>Anderson had invented a “Ph.D. to lecturer” program at Michigan, to give new doctors a grace year to teach and to apply for jobs, and Chuang was to be the inaugural fellow. Still, Chuang blanched as they discussed the scope of her new obligations. She had four classes to help teach, and was supposed to give talks at a slew of international conferences. How should she prepare these audition-like presentations?</p><p>“Don’t write up,” Anderson advised. “Just do PowerPoint slides.” Behind her, a PC was mounted on a treadmill desk; she tries to get in ten thousand steps a day. She went on, “Give the big picture, make points to motivate the idea, and punt all the objections to the Q.&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;A. What ensues is a very lively Q.&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;A.”</p><p>Chuang knitted her brow. An esteemed philosopher at Oxford reads his talks, she said.</p><p>“Yeah, horrible,” Anderson said. “So retro.” The issue was that people were afraid of questions, and tried to address them all preëmptively. She laughed darkly: <em class="">Hhhh-aahr-aahr-aahr</em>. “Philosophers are too risk averse, and this makes listening to philosophers <em class="">tedious</em>.”</p><p>Anderson landed at Michigan out of graduate school, in 1987, and never left, despite being courted by other universities, starting with an “out of the blue” tenure-track job offer from Princeton the following year. Michigan, despite its winters, seemed a warmer place. The school was huge, but Anderson liked the size. (“For any subject I’m interested in—and I’m interested in a zillion things—I know there will be an expert who can lead me to essential sources,” she says.) Still, there were challenges. On her first day, a senior colleague took her to lunch—a friendly welcome, she assumed, until he started telling her his thoughts on why she was the only woman in the department. Then he lighted into Martha Nussbaum, who had taught her Plato at Harvard, and Nussbaum’s recent book “The Fragility of Goodness,” which had made her a star. Many people have doubted that women are capable of doing good philosophy, he mused, and this book offered no counterevidence. Anderson remembers, “I was, like, <em class="">Uh-oh</em>.”</p><p>Until then, Anderson had never really considered the role of gender in her career. She later learned that there were fewer women in academic philosophy than in either math or astrophysics, and a sense of the way inequality was built into that pipeline propelled her interest in feminist philosophy. In 1993, she became the first woman in Michigan’s department to be tenured from within.</p><p>Her first book, “Value in Ethics and Economics,” appeared that year, announcing one of her major projects: reconciling value (an amorphous ascription of worth that is a keystone of ethics and economics) with pluralism (the fact that people seem to value things in different ways). Philosophers have often assumed that pluralistic value reflects human fuzziness—we’re loose, we’re confused, and we mix rational thought with sentimental responses. Anderson proposed that, actually, pluralism of value wasn’t the fuzz but the thing itself. She offered an “expressive” theory: in her view, each person’s values could be various because they were socially expressed, and thus shaped by the range of contexts and relationships at play in a life. Instead of positing value as a basic, abstract quality across society (the way “utility” functioned for economists), she saw value<span data-page="page_5"></span> as something determined by the details of an individual’s history. Like her idea of relational equality, this model resisted the temptation to flatten human variety toward a unifying standard. In doing so, it helped expand the realm of free and reasoned economic choice.</p><p>Consider a couple who has worked for years to run a family restaurant and is offered a corporate buyout, worth more than they could earn by keeping it open. Traditional economists and many philosophers would say, Take the money! That would maximize value. Maybe you can use it to start a new restaurant. In Anderson’s expressive model, the couple might have a sound reason to refuse. “They did not work all those years to make millions for some brand-x corporation,” she wrote. “A concern for the narrative unity of their lives, for what meaning their present choices make of their past actions, could rationally motivate them to turn down the offer.” The value of that narrative unity was beyond the reach of the market: for that couple, no price was the right price.</p><p>In this sense, “Value in Ethics and Economics” was partly about reclaiming moral authority from the cold-eyed neoclassical economists who guided policy in the eighties and nineties. Anderson’s model unseated the premises of rational-choice theory, in which individuals invariably make utility-maximizing decisions, occasionally in heartless-seeming ways. It ran with, rather than against, moral intuition. Because values were plural, it was perfectly rational to choose to spend evenings with your family, say, <em class="">and</em> have guilt toward the people you left in the lurch at work.</p><p>The theory also pointed out the limits on free-market ideologies, such as libertarianism. In ethics, it broke across old factional debates. The core idea “has been picked up on by people across quite a range of positions,” Peter Railton, one of Anderson’s longtime colleagues, says. “Kantians and consequentialists alike”—people who viewed morality in terms of duties and obligations, and those who measured the morality of actions by their effects in the world—“could look at it and see something important.”</p><p>“She has this way of challenging the dominant model and assumptions in multiple areas,” Sally Haslanger, a former colleague of Anderson’s who is now at M.I.T., says. “She has that ability to turn the lens so that people who thought they knew the way to proceed are now seeing very different things.”</p><p>Part of the novelty in Anderson’s approach came from a shift in how she practiced philosophy. Traditionally, the discipline is taught through a-priori thought—you start with basic principles and reason forward. Anderson, by contrast, sought to work empirically, using information gathered from the world, identifying problems to be solved not abstractly but through the experienced problems of real people.</p><p>Shortly after arriving at Michigan, she had been struck by the work of a law-school colleague, Don Herzog, which incorporated a turn-of-the-century school of American thought called pragmatism. To a pragmatist, “truth” is an instrumental and contingent state; a claim is true for now if, by all tests, it works for now. This approach, and the friendship that had borne it, enriched Anderson’s work. Herzog has offered notes on almost everything she has published in the past three decades.</p><p>In 2004, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy asked Anderson to compose its entry on the moral philosophy of John Dewey, who helped carry pragmatist methods into the social realm. Dewey had an idea of democracy as a system of good habits that began in civil life. He was an anti-ideologue with an eye for pluralism. Anderson was quickly smitten. In 2013, when she was elevated to Michigan’s highest professorship and got to name her chair—a kind of academic spirit animal—she styled herself the John Dewey Distinguished University Professor. “Dewey argued that the primary problems for ethics in the modern world concerned the ways society ought to be organized, rather than personal decisions of the individual,” Anderson wrote in her Stanford Encyclopedia entry. As she turned to problems in her work and her life, his thought became a crucial guide.</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>Anderson and her husband went to lunch at Zingerman’s, a deli restaurant in downtown Ann Arbor. It was a warm weekend, and Anderson, who had just come from a walk of a few thousand steps in the arboretum, ordered peaches with jalapeño dressing and a bowl of gazpacho. Jacobi, who had come from a four-mile jog, got a brisket sandwich, fruit salad, and a Dr. Brown’s black-cherry soda. “I should never come here after running,” he told the woman at the counter. (He often strikes up small, self-revealing conversations with people at registers.) Outside, they found a table in the shade. Anderson sat, and Jacobi put an arm around her.</p><p>“I’ve got my love puppy,” Anderson said.</p><p>He stiffened indignantly. “Your love <em class="">dog</em>,” he said.</p><p>“My nickname for him, depending on my mood, is Hundie or Hound Dog—or Doggie,” Anderson explained.</p><div class="Callout__inset-left___2rZjf" data-type="callout" data-callout="inset-left"><div class="CartoonEmbed__container___vf5AM "><a class="Link__link___3dWao CartoonEmbed__captionLink___14pNW " href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a22379"><figure class="Figure__figure___U_9Te  "><div class="placeholder"><div class="placeholder-buttress"></div><div class="placeholder-content"><div class="Image__image___1PhYl" role="button" tabindex="0"><picture class="component-responsive-image"><source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5c1d1d1b1fa04b334bab0818/master/w_280,c_limit/190107_a22379.jpg, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5c1d1d1b1fa04b334bab0818/master/w_560,c_limit/190107_a22379.jpg 2x"><source srcset="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5c1d1d1b1fa04b334bab0818/master/w_727,c_limit/190107_a22379.jpg, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5c1d1d1b1fa04b334bab0818/master/w_1454,c_limit/190107_a22379.jpg 2x"><img alt="" src="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5c1d1d1b1fa04b334bab0818/master/w_727,c_limit/190107_a22379.jpg" title=""></picture></div></div></div><figcaption class="ImageCaption__captionWrapper___2h5XI Figure__cartoonCaptionWrapper___1tdkA ImageCaption__default___3TPB5"><span class="ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO">“Sandworm!

He also has a stellar repertoire of doctorly self-deprecating jokes (“As a teen-ager, I wanted to be a moral hero, like Christ or Schweitzer, but now I’m aiming for law-abiding”) and a gregariousness that tends to flatter his wife. Anderson is a genius, he says, while he’s a schmo. (He is actually a respected internist in the Henry Ford Health System, which serves all Detroit.) Their lives<span data-page="page_6"></span> today aren’t so much intertwined as subject to a division of labor. Jacobi purports to have no idea what his salary is, because Anderson keeps the family finances. He maintains the social calendar, because it might not otherwise occur to Anderson to leave her desk. At their first meeting, Anderson explained Hegel’s notion of self-alienated spirit. (“The thing is, not only did Liz explain it but it made sense to me for about an hour,” Jacobi says.) On their honeymoon, in the Southwest, they hired a geologist to accompany them and lecture about rocks.</p><p>Yet they disagreed while raising their two children. As a toddler, their elder child was given to tantrums. Their younger child was diagnosed as being on the spectrum; Anderson took time off to work with him one-on-one. “Our kids had a certain degree of emotional disregulation, and Liz was unbelievably astute about, and willing to tolerate, being yelled at without escalating the emotion in return,” Jacobi said. “She probably exceeds me in that capacity.”</p><p>“Dave is a sweetie pie, but he does have this Germanic streak,” Anderson said.</p><p>Their elder child, Sean, came out as genderqueer in high school, and began work as an activist. During senior year, Sean left home to move in with a partner, a trans woman. Jacobi and Anderson disagreed about the appropriate parental response.</p><p>“Liz is very much laissez-faire,” Jacobi said, and took a large bite of his sandwich.</p><p>“It’s more that I don’t think you control where your kids’ hearts go,” Anderson replied.</p><p>This was, after all, exactly the sort of freedom that she championed in her work. Trouble arose only when Sean announced an intention to go to art school instead of a liberal-arts college. Anderson saw this as a confounding unwillingness to walk through open doors of opportunity.</p><p>“Having a kid who was a communist anarchist? That was nothing for Liz,” Jacobi said. “Having a kid who was lesbian? That took Liz about two seconds to live with. Transgender? That took about five seconds. A kid who didn’t want to go to college? Heresy.”</p><p>“I was in tears,” Anderson said. “I’m, like, ‘Art school? You’re an anarchist, and ninety-nine per cent of people there go into commercial art. <em class="">Really</em>?’&nbsp;”</p><p>A year ago, Anderson and Jacobi became empty nesters. Sean, who no longer identifies as an anarchist, wound up at Clark University, en route to a career in public health or social work. Their younger child is at Eastern Michigan University, and is thriving on his own. Their parents say that having children educated them away from the idea of a fixed plan.</p><p>“Parents of autistic kids are always struggling with gluten-free diets and chelation,” Jacobi said. “They’re desperate for a ‘normal’ kid. Liz and I see eye to eye that, when you give up hoping for some magical treatment, you can just focus on the kid in front of you.”</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>Motherhood coincided with a transformation in Anderson’s methods. She started working with historians, trying to hone her understanding of ideas by studying them in the context of their creation. Take Rousseau’s apparent support of direct democracy. It’s rarely mentioned that, at the moment when he made that argument, his home town of Geneva had been taken over by oligarchs who claimed to represent the public. Pragmatism said that an idea was an instrument, which naturally gave rise to such questions as: an instrument for what, and where, and when?</p><p>Her approach broadened in other ways, too. In “What Is the Point of Equality?,” Anderson had already started to drift away from what philosophers, following Rawls, call ideal theory, based on an end vision for a perfectly just society. As Anderson began a serious study of race in America, though, she found herself losing faith in that approach entirely.</p><p>Broadly, there’s a culturally right and a culturally left ideal theory for race and society. The rightist version calls for color blindness. Instead of making a fuss about skin and ethnicity, its advocates say, society should treat people as people, and let the best and the hardest working rise. The leftist theory envisions identity communities: for once, give black people (or women, or members of other historically oppressed groups) the resources and opportunities they need, including, if they want it, civil infrastructure for themselves. In “The Imperative of Integration,” published in 2010, Anderson tore apart both of these models. Sure, it might be nice to live in a color-blind society, she wrote, but that’s nothing like the one that exists. In one study she cited, sixty per cent of people who saw a crime report on TV that hadn’t identified the suspect thought that it had; seventy per cent of those people thought that the suspect was black. Other research found that when white people pretended not to notice race they often acquired alienating tics, such as avoiding eye contact. Color blindness would simply lock in problems past correction.</p><p>But the case for self-segregation was also weak. Affinity groups provided welcome comfort, yet that wasn’t the same as power or equality, Anderson pointed out. And there was a goose-and-gander problem. Either you let only certain groups self-segregate (certifying their subordinate status) or you also permitted, say, white men to do it, and—well, we have a lot of data from that experiment, and they’re not encouraging.</p><p>Anderson’s solution was “integration,” a concept that, especially in progressive circles, had been<span data-page="page_7"></span> uncool since the late sixties. Integration, by her lights, meant mixing on the basis of equality. It was not assimilation. It required adjustments from all groups. Anderson laid out four integrative stages: formal desegregation (no legal separation), spatial integration (different people share neighborhoods), formal social integration (they work together, and are one another’s bosses), and informal social integration (they become buddies, get married, start families). Black students in integrated high schools, according to one study, had higher graduation rates than those in segregated schools, even controlling for socioeconomic background, parental education, and other factors. Students—black <em class="">and</em> white—at integrated schools went on to lead more integrated lives.</p><p>Some philosophers of color welcomed the book. “She’s taking the need for racial justice seriously, and you could hardly find another white political philosopher over a period of decades doing that,” Charles Mills, a philosopher at the <em class="small">CUNY</em> Graduate Center, says. For others, though, a white woman making recommendations on race policy raised questions of perspective. She was engaging through a mostly white Anglo-American tradition. She worked from the premise that, because she drew on folders full of studies, the limits of her own perspective were not constraining. At the same time, in attending to these empirical findings over doctrine, she announced herself as a non-ideal theorist: a philosopher with no end vision of society. The approach recalls E.&nbsp;L. Doctorow’s description of driving at night: “You can see only as far as the headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way.”</p><p>An integrative project also makes demands of academic practice. “Liz has a genuine concern for fostering intellectual diversity,” Daniel Jacobson, the only philosopher in her department who identifies as conservative, says. (He hosts a symposium for right-of-center thought; she supports the endeavor and sometimes joins in.) Recently, Anderson changed the way she assigns undergraduate essays: instead of requiring students to argue a position and fend off objections, doubling down on their original beliefs, she asks them to discuss their position with someone who disagrees, and to explain how and why, if at all, the discussion changed their views. Michigan, which, since 1988, has run a Program on Intergroup Relations, has avoided many of the impasses around identity and speech that have unsettled campuses elsewhere. “It’s not like there’s no racial politics,” Anderson says. “There’s lots of racial politics, but people are talking to one another.”</p><p>Anderson’s closest contact with a firestorm came last year, when <em class="">Hypatia</em>, a feminist philosophy journal on whose board she sat, was pressured to retract an article exploring similarities between Caitlyn Jenner’s gender transition and Rachel Dolezal’s identification as a black woman. The board ultimately stood by its publication, with a statement rich in Andersonian language. “The Board affirms <em class="">Hypatia’s</em> commitment to pluralist inquiry,” it read. The suggestion was that <em class="">how</em> you are, not who you are, supplies a legitimate basis for social action.</p><p>In certain ways, this style of thinking is at odds with current modes. Derrick Darby, a philosopher who grew up in the Queensbridge projects, in New York City, and is the only tenured black professor in Anderson’s department, works in the Michigan-school mold, drawing heavily on empirical research. He taught “The Imperative of Integration” in dialogue with his own data-based critique. “Ideas of racial hierarchy will play out in different ways even within an integrated context,” he says. “Black and brown kids are disproportionately assigned to special education. There’s tracking that still goes on.” But his personal experience made him chary, too. “Liz has a view that you pull people up from the projects and send them on their ways into the élite,” he says. As someone who’d made that journey, he thought she underweighted the constraints—the unfreedom—involved in being “the only damn black person in so many rooms.” At one point, Anderson visited Darby’s class. “We spoke about our experiences,” he recalls, “and why it led us to focus our work as we did”: childhood for him and parenting for her. They both ended up in tears.</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>The challenge of pluralism is the challenge of modern society: maintaining equality amid difference in a culture given to constant and unpredictable change. It is the fashion in America these days to define political virtue by position. Richard is on the side of history, we might say, because he’s to the left of Irma on this issue and slightly to the right of Marco on that one. Anderson would resist this way of thinking, not least because it calls for intellectual convergence. It’s anti-pluralistic and tribalist. It celebrates ideology; it presumes that certain models have absolute, not situational, value. Rather than fighting for the ascendancy of certain positions, Anderson suggests, citizens should fight to bolster healthy institutions and systems—those which insure that all views and experiences will be heard. Today’s righteous projects, after all, will inevitably seem fatuous and blinkered from the vantage of another age.</p><p>By some measures, the late nineteen-sixties was a time when liberalism’s standing as an American creed, while appearing to intensify, frayed. It was, especially from the perspective of Anderson’s childhood, an era characterized by ideological aggression: campus uprisings and urban riots, assassinations and increasingly fruitless debates. “The world was falling apart,” she says, channelling her parents’ perception at the time. In the home of Eve and Olof Anderson, this mounting chaos and anger became a transformational pressure. After the showdown between protesters and police at the<span data-page="page_8"></span> 1968 Democratic National Convention, Olof cast a vote for Nixon. Later, leery of increasingly doctrinal socialist ideas, he and Eve dropped their Democratic affiliation. “I just got fed up with it,” Olof says.</p><p>Today, Eve and Olof Anderson support President Donald Trump. They describe themselves as conservative on social matters and libertarian on everything else. “We do come together with Elizabeth on many levels—issues of right and wrong and family,” Eve says. “She’s a wonderful wife and mother.”</p><p>Where there used to be daily discussion of the news between Anderson and her parents, though, dialogue about politics has gone largely dead. Anderson, in her writing, often makes use of conservative vantages, like a painter assessing her canvas from the other side of the room. Her work can seem like a long argument addressed to readers across the aisle: an attempt to make them understand and, maybe, to win them back.</p><p>One of Anderson’s premises is that the project of fairness is more shared, across the spectrum, than many people suppose. Some years ago, she began to envisage a comprehensive history of egalitarianism. How did egalitarian ideas emerge, and how had they changed? How did they relate to ideas about the uses and abuses of state power?</p><p>“Originally, I thought, I’ll start mid-seventeenth century,” she said. “But then you realize, well, you can’t really deal with that until you deal with the Protestant radicals of the Reformation, like the Anabaptists. But the Anabaptists are harking back to early Christian egalitarian communities—so maybe I have to start looking at, like, the New Testament. <em class="">Hah-hah-hah!</em>” Eventually, Anderson ended up at the hunter-gatherers. It occurred to her that hundreds of thousands of years might be a lot to cover in one book, so she decided that it would be two books, or three. Possibly five. Regardless, it will take her a while to finish, maybe the rest of her life. But it will be her big project, the unified picture that she leaves behind.</p><p>Anderson was invited to deliver the Tanner Lectures at Princeton in 2015, and decided to launch the project there. Many people still believed that market economies were a sound foundation of freedom. Yet, she found, ninety per cent of female restaurant workers reported being sexually harassed. Some poultry-industry employees were said to have worn diapers for lack of breaks. About seven million American workers had been compelled to support political positions under threat from their bosses. Such people could not be called free.</p><p>Anderson zeroed in on Adam Smith, whose “The Wealth of Nations,” published in 1776, is taken as a keystone of free-market ideology. At the time, English labor was subject to uncompensated apprenticeships, domestic servitude, and some measure of clerical dominion. Rigid hierarchies, from the king to the pauper, were maintained by an arcane system of debts, favors, and gifts. Smith saw the markets as an escape from that order. Their “most important” function, he explained, was to bring “liberty and security” to those “who had before lived almost in a continual state of war with their neighbours, and of servile dependency upon their superiors.”</p><p>Smith, in other words, was an egalitarian. He had written “The Wealth of Nations” in no small part to be a solution to what we’d now call structural inequality—the intractable, compounding privileges of an arbitrary hierarchy. It was a historical irony that, a century later, writers such as Marx pointed to the market as a structure of dominion over workers; in truth, Smith and Marx had shared a socioeconomic project. And yet Marx had not been wrong to trash Smith’s ideas, because, during the time between them, the world around Smith’s model had changed, and it was no longer a useful tool.</p><p>“The Industrial Revolution was a cataclysmic event for egalitarians,” Anderson explains in “Private Government” (2017), a book that she assembled from the Tanner Lectures. Today, people still try to use, variously, both Smith’s and Marx’s tools on a different, postindustrial world:</p><blockquote><p>Images of free market society that made sense prior to the Industrial Revolution continue to circulate today as ideals, blind to the gross mismatch between the background social assumptions reigning in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and today’s institutional realities. We are told that our choice is between free markets and state control, when most adults live their working lives under a third thing entirely: <em class="">private government.</em></p></blockquote><div class="Callout__inset-left___2rZjf" data-type="callout" data-callout="inset-left"><div class="CartoonEmbed__container___vf5AM "><a class="Link__link___3dWao CartoonEmbed__captionLink___14pNW " href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a21965"><figure class="Figure__figure___U_9Te  "><div class="placeholder"><div class="placeholder-buttress"></div><div class="placeholder-content"><div class="Image__image___1PhYl" role="button" tabindex="0"><picture class="component-responsive-image"><source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5c1d1d1b286bc006c37e86c5/master/w_280,c_limit/190107_a21965.jpg, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5c1d1d1b286bc006c37e86c5/master/w_560,c_limit/190107_a21965.jpg 2x"><source srcset="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5c1d1d1b286bc006c37e86c5/master/w_727,c_limit/190107_a21965.jpg, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5c1d1d1b286bc006c37e86c5/master/w_1454,c_limit/190107_a21965.jpg 2x"><img alt="" src="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5c1d1d1b286bc006c37e86c5/master/w_727,c_limit/190107_a21965.jpg" title=""></picture></div></div></div><figcaption class="ImageCaption__captionWrapper___2h5XI Figure__cartoonCaptionWrapper___1tdkA ImageCaption__default___3TPB5"><span class="ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO">“Is the fish local?”</span></figcaption></figure></a><div class="CartoonEmbed__socialWrapper___3-ICo"><div class="SocialShare__socialShare___92Ene SocialShare__grey___dItUm CartoonEmbed__socialShare___13L3P"><a class="Link__link___3dWao SocialShare__link___Sad7k SocialShare__facebook___Jm71k " rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" data-track-type="socialShare" data-track-location="cartoon" data-source="facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa21965&amp;display=popup&amp;ref=plugin"></a><a class="Link__link___3dWao SocialShare__link___Sad7k SocialShare__twitter___3O6QA " rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" data-track-type="socialShare" data-track-location="cartoon" data-source="twitter" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa21965&amp;text=A%20New%20Yorker%20Cartoon&amp;tw_p=tweetbutton&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa21965"></a><a class="Link__link___3dWao SocialShare__link___Sad7k SocialShare__email___TlCif " rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" data-track-type="socialShare" data-track-location="cartoon" data-source="email" href="mailto:?subject=From%20newyorker.com:%20A%20New%20Yorker%20Cartoon&amp;body=%E2%80%9CIs%20the%20fish%20local%3F%E2%80%9D%0D%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa21965"></a><a class="Link__link___3dWao CartoonEmbed__shop___1TDi0 " rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" data-track-type="shop" data-track-location="cartoon-shop" href="https://condenaststore.com/conde-nast-brand/cartoonbank"></a></div></div></div></div><p>What else could you call the modern workplace, where superiors can issue changing orders, control attire, surveil correspondence, demand medical testing, define schedules, and monitor communication, such as social-media posts? The decisions that a company makes, like the installation of cubicles in the bank in Harvard Square, are presented as none of its employees’ business (hence “private”). Defenders of this state of affairs often counter that people negotiate their salaries and can always leave. Anderson notes that low-level workers can rarely wrangle raises, and that real-world constraints eliminate exit power. (Workers are sometimes bound by non-compete agreements, and usually cannot get unemployment insurance if they quit.) It was as if relational equality could be suspended between nine and five—a habit that, inevitably, affects life beyond work.</p><p>American progressivism is in the midst of a messy reckoning. During the nineties, upper-tail wage inequality (the gap between the middle class and the rich) exceeded lower-tail inequality (the gap between the poor and the middle class). Since then, upper-tail inequality has<span data-page="page_9"></span> continued to grow while lower-tail inequality has remained basically unchanged. The unnaturalness of this top-heavy arrangement, combined with growing evidence of power abuses, has given many people reason to believe that something is fishy about the structure of American equality. Socialist and anti-capitalist models are again in vogue.</p><p>Anderson offers a different corrective path. She thinks it’s fine for some people to earn more than others. If you’re a brilliant potter, and people want to pay you more than the next guy for your pottery, great! (If you’re just O.K. but want to work extra industriously for the difference, that’s fair, too.) The problem isn’t that talent and income are distributed in unequal parcels. The problem is that Jeff Bezos earns more than a hundred thousand dollars a minute, while Amazon warehouse employees, many talented and hardworking, have reportedly resorted to urinating in bottles in lieu of a bathroom break. That circumstance reflects some structure of hierarchical oppression. It is a rip in the democratic fabric, and it’s increasingly the norm.</p><p>Andersonism holds that we don’t have to give up on market society if we can recognize and correct for its limitations—it may even be our best hope, because it’s friendlier to pluralism than most alternatives are. And we shouldn’t commit ourselves to an ideal system of any sort, whether socialist or libertarian, because a model set in motion like a Swiss watch will become a trap as soon as circumstances change. Instead, we must be flexible. We must remain alert. We must solve problems collaboratively, in the moment, using society’s ears and eyes and the best tools that we can find.</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>Anderson’s lecture at Ohio State University was called “The Great Reversal: How Neoliberalism Turned the Economic Aspirations of Liberalism Upside Down.” The three-hundred-seat Ohio Union theatre was near capacity that afternoon. Anderson came to the lectern in her flowing black ensemble and noisily cleared her throat into the microphone. A wage-and-productivity graph appeared on a screen behind her. She had prepared a PowerPoint.</p><p>“You can see that, from about 1950 to 1970, the typical American’s wages kept up with productivity growth,” she said. Then, around 1974, she went on, hourly compensation stagnated. American wages have been effectively flat for the past few decades, with the gains of productivity increasingly going to shareholders and to salaries for big bosses.</p><p>What changed? Anderson rattled off a constellation of factors, from strengthened intellectual-property law to winnowed antitrust law. Financialization, deregulation. Plummeting taxes on capital alongside rising payroll taxes. Privatization, which exchanged modest public-sector salaries for C.E.O. paydays. She gazed into the audience and blinked. “So now we have to ask: What has been used to justify this rather dramatic shift of labor-share of income?” she said.</p><p>The answer, of course, was classical liberal philosophers. Anderson clicked forward to a slide with a pair of unattributed quotations, describing “the property which every man has in his own labour” as “the most sacred and inviolable,” and championing good conditions for working people.</p><p>“Smith!” someone cried.</p><p>“<em class="">Good</em> Adam Smith,” Anderson said. The classical liberals had been anti-monopolistic. “They opposed all forms of unfree labor—not just slavery but serfdom, peonage, unpaid apprenticeship,” she said, peering at some undergraduates in front.</p><p>While spending the summer researching the history of the Protestant work ethic for her Seeley Lectures, at Cambridge, this spring, Anderson had come across a rarely collected essay by Jeremy Bentham, who was born twenty-five years after Smith. Bentham is widely known for coming up with the idea for a creepy surveillance prison, the panopticon, which Michel Foucault much later turned into a metaphor for institutional control. Anderson found that, in this obscure essay, “Pauper Management Improved: Particularly by Means of an Application of the Panopticon Principle of Construction,” Bentham had himself proposed that panopticons be used to manage not just criminals but also the poor, the elderly, and the disabled. “He projected that this model would be really great for everyone, but especially for the owner of the panopticon,” Anderson told the audience in Ohio. “He had detailed calculations. You could get three-hundred-per-cent profits from an adult man and two-hundred-per-cent profits from an adult woman. But the greatest source of profits of all”—she paused—“would come from child labor.”</p><p>Behind Anderson, a slide of Bentham’s quasi-mummified body appeared. She grew visibly excited. “&nbsp;‘Pauper Management Improved,’ I think, is one of the <em class="">original</em> sources of the arguments for the privatization of public functions,” she said. It was no wonder that industrial-age thinking was riddled with contradictions: it reflected what Anderson called “the plutocratic reversal” of classical liberal ideas. Those perversely reversed ideas about freedom were the ones that found a home in U.S. policy, and, well, here we were.</p><p>Anderson followed up with an ebullient Q.&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;A., and then was taken to the faculty club for dinner. During a lull in the conversation, a professor leaned down the table and said, “So, John Stuart Mill.”</p><p>“<em class="">Oohhhhhhh!</em>&nbsp;” the other philosophers cried in unison, as if he’d Z-snapped in her face. He was a Mill scholar, and nitpicking was expected.</p><p>Anderson laughed: <em class="">Hah-hah-hah!</em> With Mill, she said, it was a mixed bag. He wasn’t a complete nut like Bentham, who had been—</p><p>“Liz, just let me know when you think it’s time to go,” said the director of the university’s ethics center, which had arranged the talk. He’d be driving her back to the<span data-page="page_final"></span> hotel.</p><p>Anderson answered with a sober nod, like Cinderella glancing at the clock, and then, her face brightening, she turned back to a table filled with strangers who had become friends.&nbsp;♦</p><p>Due to a transcription error, a previous version of this article misquoted Elizabeth Anderson. She referred to the types of labor opposed by classical liberals as “unfree labor,” not “free labor.”</p></div></div></div></div><footer class="ArticleFooter__footer___3-wlJ"><span class="ArticleDisclaimer__articleDisclaimer___2kCNX">This article appears in the print edition of the January 7, 2019, issue, with the headline “The Structure of Equality.”</span><div class="ArticleContributors__bio___3XQjk"><div class="ArticleContributors__contributorWrapper___1CrIJ"><div class="Avatar__avatar___1_uRc ArticleContributors__bioAvatar___11Nu0"><a class="Link__link___3dWao  " href="/contributors/nathan-heller"><div class="Image__image___1PhYl" role="button" tabindex="0"><picture class="component-responsive-image"><source srcset="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b792179605b11ad8f18/1:1/w_130,c_limit/heller-nathan.png, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b792179605b11ad8f18/1:1/w_260,c_limit/heller-nathan.png 2x"><img alt="" src="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b792179605b11ad8f18/1:1/w_130,c_limit/heller-nathan.png" title=""></picture></div></a></div><ul class="ArticleContributors__contributorBios___3_jrJ false"><li><p class="ArticleContributors__contributorBioText___3m1QB">Nathan Heller began contributing to The New Yorker in 2011, and joined the magazine as a staff writer in 2013.</p><a class="Link__link___3dWao ArticleContributors__contributorBioLink___3ifgZ " href="/contributors/nathan-heller">Read more »</a></li></ul></div></div><div data-cm-unit="show-failsafe"><div data-cns="cns-slot-end-of-article" class="ArticleFooter__adEndArticle___2_iy_"></div></div><div class=""><form><section class="NewsletterSubscribe__newsletterComponent___1ZI2a"><p class="NewsletterSubscribe__newsletterDek___29WDu">Never miss a big <i>New Yorker</i> story again.

stories trace the sweep of history, but their details are definingly particular. In the summer of 1979, Elizabeth Anderson, then a rising junior at Swarthmore College, got a job as a bookkeeper at a bank in Harvard Square. Every morning, she and the other bookkeepers would process a large stack of bounced checks. Businesses usually had two accounts, one for payroll and the other for costs and supplies. When companies were short of funds, Anderson noticed, they would always bounce their payroll checks. It made a cynical kind of sense: a worker who was owed money wouldn’t go anywhere, or could be replaced, while an unpaid supplier would stop supplying. Still, Anderson found it disturbing that businesses would write employees phony checks, burdening them with bounce fees. It appeared to happen all the time."],["p","Midway through summer, the bank changed its office plan. When Anderson had started, the bookkeepers worked in rows of desks. Coördination was easy—a check that fell under someone else’s purview could be handed down the line—and there was conversation throughout the day. Then cubicles were added. That transformation interrupted the workflow, the conversational flow, and most other things about the bookkeepers’ days. Their capacities as workers were affected, yet the change had come down from on high."],["p","These problems nagged at Anderson that summer and beyond. She had arrived at college as a libertarian who wanted to study economics. In the spirit of liberal-arts exploration, though, she enrolled in an introductory philosophy course whose reading list included Karl Marx’s 1844 manuscripts concerning worker alienation. Anderson thought that Marx’s economic arguments about the declining rate of profit and the labor theory of value fell apart under scrutiny. But she was stirred by his observational writings about the experience of work. Her summer at the bank drove home the fact that systemic behavior ",["em","inside"]," the workplace was part of the socioeconomic fabric, too: it mattered whether you were the person who got a clear check or a bounced check, whether a hierarchy made it easier or harder for you to excel and advance. Yet economists had no way of factoring those influences into their thinking. As far as they were concerned, a job was a contract—an exchange of labor for money—and if you were unhappy you left. The nature of the workplace, where most people spent half their lives, was a black box."],["p","Anderson grew intellectually restless. Other ideas that were presented as cornerstones of economics, such as rational-choice theory, didn’t match the range of human behaviors that she was seeing in the wild. She liked how philosophy approached big problems that cut across various fields, but she was most excited by methods that she encountered in the history and the philosophy of science. Like philosophers, scientists chased Truth, but their theories were understood to be provisional—tools for resolving problems as they appeared, models valuable only to the extent that they explained and predicted what showed in experiments. A Newtonian model of motion had worked beautifully for a long time, but then people noticed bits of unaccountable data, and relativity emerged as a stronger theory. Couldn’t disciplines like philosophy work that way, too?"],["p","The bank experience showed how you could be oppressed by hierarchy, working in an environment where you were neither free nor equal. But this implied that freedom and equality were bound together in some way beyond the basic state of being unenslaved, which was an unorthodox notion. Much social thought is rooted in the idea of a conflict between the two. If individuals exercise freedoms, conservatives like to say, some inequalities will naturally result. Those on the left basically agree—and thus allow constraints on personal freedom in order to reduce inequality. The philosopher Isaiah Berlin called the opposition between equality and freedom an “intrinsic, irremovable element in human life.” It is our fate as a society, he believed, to haggle toward a balance between them."],["p","In this respect, it might seem odd that, through history, equality and freedom have arrived together as ideals. What if they weren’t opposed, Anderson wondered, but, like the sugar-phosphate chains in DNA, interlaced in a structure that we might not yet understand? What if the way most of us think about the relation between equality and freedom—the very basis for the polarized, intractable political division of this moment—is wrong?"],["p","At fifty-nine, Anderson is the chair of the University of Michigan’s department of philosophy and a champion of the view that equality and freedom are mutually dependent, enmeshed in changing conditions through time. Working at the intersection of moral and political philosophy, social science, and economics, she has become a leading theorist of democracy and social justice. She has built a case, elaborated across decades, that equality is the basis for a free society. Her work, drawing on real-world problems and information, has helped to redefine the way contemporary philosophy is done, leading what might be called the Michigan school of thought. Because she brings together ideas from both the left and the right to battle increasing inequality, Anderson may be the philosopher best suited to this awkward moment in American life. She builds a democratic frame for a society in which people come from different places and are predisposed to

University.",["inline-embed",{"type":"analytics","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22analytics%22%2C%22url%22%3A%222%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":""}]," With a bit of time before her talk, she sat in a high-backed chair and spoke with undergraduates about her work. “Almost everyone wants to be respected and esteemed by others, so how can you make that compatible with a society of equals?” she asked. The students, looking a touch wary, listened intently and stared."],["p","People who meet Anderson in the world often find that she is more approachable than they imagined an august philosopher to be. She is, she’d be the first to say, a klutz. Most days, she wears a colorful cotton blouse, hiking sneakers, and hard-wearing khakis that could bear a carabiner full of keys. “Liz doesn’t put on airs,” her friend Rebecca Eisenberg, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School, says. Dan Troyka, another friend, says, “She could be at a potluck as easily as at a philosophy symposium.” She talks on a dais the way she does to buddies over lunch—in a trumpety voice, flattened across mid-American vowels—and has only a nodding acquaintance with many decorums. A few friends felt unsettled when she was interviewed on cable news earlier this year; it was the first time they had ever seen her wearing makeup."],["p","In Ohio, she wore a loose black dress, trimmed in hot pink, over billowing pants and black flats. (“Feminists work to overcome the internal obstacles to choice—self-abnegation, lack of confidence, and low self-esteem—that women often face from internalizing norms of femininity,” Anderson, who holds a joint professorship in women’s studies, has written.) She crossed her right leg over her left and blinked as students formulated questions. She takes great pleasure in arranging information in useful forms; if she weren’t a philosopher, she thinks, she’d like to be a mapmaker, or a curator of archeological displays in museums."],["p","As the students listened, she sketched out the entry-level idea that one basic way to expand equality is by expanding the range of valued fields within a society. Unlike a hardscrabble peasant community of yore in which the only skill that anyone cared about might be agricultural prowess, a society with many valued arenas lets individuals who are good at art or storytelling or sports or making people laugh receive a bit of love."],["p","“Is the idea that we expand the number of values so that everyone gets a piece of the scene?” a young woman asked. She was trying to understand how hierarchies of esteem could be compatible with equality. “Or is there some sort of respectable limit, so we’re, like, We’ve sort of found the things we value, and you’ve got to aim for one of them!”"],["p","Anderson replied with a bright cackle of delight: ",["em","Hah-hah-hah!"]," Friends have noted that her laughter, like the autumn weather, comes in warm and chilly forms. There’s a staccato laugh of encouraging good humor (",["em","Hah!"],"). There is, more ominously, a rough, guttural chuckle of declining barometric pressure (",["em","Hhhh-aahr-aahr-aahr"],"), with which she introduces ideas she considers comically, dangerously bad. Addressing the student’s question, she posited endless innovation within general values. “Like, every society has music, and great musical performers always get esteem,” she said, extending her forearms in a teddy-bear position of embrace."],["p","In general, Anderson is outgoing when conversation turns to ideas and shy about other things. (“If you want to make her totally uncomfortable, tell her she has to go to a fancy function in a cocktail dress,” her husband says.) Now she cleared her throat noisily. “If you look back at the origins of liberalism, it starts first with a certain settlement about religious difference,” she said. “Catholics, Protestants—they’re killing each other! Finally, Germany, England, all these places say, We’re tired of these people killing each other, so we’re going to make a peace settlement: religious toleration, live and let live.”"],["p","She spread her hands wider. “Then something remarkable happens,” she said. “People now have the freedom to have crosscutting identities in different domains. At church, I’m one thing. At work, I’m something else. I’m something else at home, or with my friends.

Do we want things to be equal where we start in life or where we land? When inequalities arise, what are the knobs that we adjust to get things back on track? Individually, people are unequal in countless ways, and together they join groups that resist blending. How do you build up a society that allows for such variety without, as in the greater-Detroit real-estate market, turning difference into a constraint? How do you move from a basic model of egalitarian variety, in which everybody gets a crack at being a star at something, to figuring out how to respond to a complex one, where people, with different allotments of talent and virtue, get unequal starts, and often meet with different constraints along the way?"],["p","In 1999, Anderson published an article in the journal ",["em","Ethics"],", titled “What Is the Point of Equality?,” laying out the argument for which she is best known. “If much recent academic work defending equality had been secretly penned by conservatives,” she began, opening a grenade in the home trenches, “could the results be any more embarrassing for egalitarians?”"],["p","The problem, she proposed, was that contemporary egalitarian thinkers had grown fixated on distribution: moving resources from lucky-seeming people to unlucky-seeming people, as if trying to spread the luck around. This was a weird and nebulous endeavor. Is an heir who puts his assets into a house in a flood zone and loses it unlucky—or lucky and dumb? Or consider a woman who marries rich, has children, and stays at home to rear them (crucial work for which she gets no wages). If she leaves the marriage to escape domestic abuse and subsequently struggles to support her kids, is that bad luck or an accretion of bad choices? Egalitarians should agree about clear cases of blameless misfortune: the quadriplegic child, the cognitively impaired adult, the teen-ager born into poverty with junkie parents. But Anderson balked there, too. By categorizing people as lucky or unlucky, she argued, these egalitarians set up a moralizing hierarchy.

Maybe you won’t be such a loser in love once potential dates see how rich you are."]],["p","By letting the lucky class go on reaping the market’s chancy rewards while asking others to concede inferior status in order to receive a drip-drip-drip of redistributive aid, these egalitarians were actually entrenching people’s status as superior or subordinate. Generations of bleeding-heart theorists had been doing the wolf’s work in shepherds’ dress."],["p","In Anderson’s view, the way forward was to shift from distributive equality to what she called relational, or democratic, equality: meeting as equals, regardless of where you were coming from or going to. This was, at heart, an exercise of freedom. The trouble was that many people, picking up on libertarian misconceptions, thought of freedom only in the frame of their own actions. If one person’s supposed freedom results in someone else’s subjugation, that is not actually a free society in action. It’s hierarchy in disguise."],["p","To be truly free, in Anderson’s assessment, members of a society had to be able to function as human beings (requiring food, shelter, medical care), to participate in production (education, fair-value pay, entrepreneurial opportunity), to execute their role as citizens (freedom to speak and to vote), and to move through civil society (parks, restaurants, workplaces, markets, and all the rest). Egalitarians should focus policy attention on areas where that order had broken down. Being homeless was an unfree condition by all counts; thus, it was incumbent on a free society to remedy that problem. A quadriplegic adult was blocked from civil society if buildings weren’t required to have ramps. Anderson’s democratic model shifted the remit of egalitarianism from the idea of equalizing wealth to the idea that people should be equally free, regardless of their differences. A society in which everyone had the same material benefits could still be unequal, in this crucial sense; democratic equality, being predicated on equal respect, wasn’t something you could simply tax into existence. “People, not nature, are responsible for turning the natural diversity of human beings into oppressive hierarchies,” Anderson wrote."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EAnderson%20was%20born%20early%2C%20at%20three%20pounds%20six%20ounces%2C%20and%20stayed%20small%20through%20childhood%2C%20wearing%20toddler-size%20clothes%20into%20the%20second%20grade.%20%E2%80%9CPeople%20tended%20to%20treat%20her%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22analytics%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522analytics%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%25224%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%20as%20much%20younger%20than%20her%20real%20age%20and%20ability%2C%E2%80%9D%20her%20mother%2C%20Eve%2C%20says.%20For%20years%2C%20she%20scarcely%20spoke%3B%20she%20had%20a%20lisp%20and%20seemed%20loath%20to%20reveal%20the%20imperfection.%20Eve%20recalls%20passing%20her%20bedroom%20and%20hearing%20her%20practicing%20her%20name%20repeatedly%2C%20%3Cem%3EE-liz-a-beth%2C%3C%2Fem%3E%20trying%20to%20get%20it%20right.%20When%20she%20was%20three%2C%20her%20mother%20asked%2C%20%E2%80%9CWhy%20do%20you%20allow%20your%20brother%20to%20talk%20for%20you%3F%E2%80%9D%E2%80%94why%20didn%E2%80%99t%20she%20speak%20for%20herself%3F%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3E%E2%80%9CUntil%20now%2C%20it%20simply%20was%20not%20necessary%2C%E2%80%9D%20Elizabeth%20said.%20It%20was%20the%20first%20full%20sentence%20that%20she%20had%20ever%20uttered.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3ETheir%20household%2C%20in%20Manchester%2C%20Connecticut%2C%20was%20mixed%20and%20fluid.%20Eve%2C%20a%20freelance%20journalist%2C%20was%20Jewish%3B%20Anderson%E2%80%99s%20father%2C%20Olof%2C%20an%20aeronautical%20engineer%2C%20had%20been%20brought%20up%20Swedish%20Lutheran.%20They%20helped%20found%20a%20local%20Unitarian%20Universalist%20worship%20space.%20Eve%20volunteered%20at%20the%20local%20Democratic%20Party%20headquarters%20and%20had%20campaigned%20for%20Adlai%20Stevenson%3B%20in%201964%2C%20Olof%20was%20elected%20to%20a%20Democratic%20seat%20on%20the%20Manchester%20board%20of%20directors.%20%E2%80%9CThey%20were%20throwing%20fund-raising%20parties%20all%20the%20time%2C%E2%80%9D%20Anderson%20recalls.%20She%2C%20in%20contrast%2C%20felt%20awkward%20and%20anxious.%20%E2%80%9CBooks%20were%20secure%E2%80%94this%20was%20something%20I%20could%20master%20and%20control.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EThe%20reading%20led%20to%20other%20interests.%20%E2%80%9CEveryone%20had%20something%20to%20teach%20her%2C%E2%80%9D%20Laura%20Grande%2C%20a%20childhood%20friend%2C%20says.%20%E2%80%9CShe%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20interested%20in%20parties%2C%20or%20in%20social%20gatherings%20that%20weren%E2%80%99t%20enlightening.%E2%80%9D%20Anderson%20dreamed%20of%20studying%20math%20and%20economics%2C%20because%20she%20loved%20the%20way%20they%20hung%20together%20in%20a%20tight%20system.%20At%20one%20point%2C%20Olof%20and%20Elizabeth%20read%20Plato%E2%80%99s%20Republic%20and%20Mill%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9COn%20Liberty%E2%80%9D%20together.%20The%20world%20outside%20seemed%20untidy%3B%20she%20found%20peace%20in%20the%20stability%20of%20shared%20ideas.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","Anderson was born early, at three pounds six ounces, and stayed small through childhood, wearing toddler-size clothes into the second grade. “People tended to treat her",["inline-embed",{"type":"analytics","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22analytics%22%2C%22url%22%3A%224%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":""}]," as much younger than her real age and ability,” her mother, Eve, says.

Eve volunteered at the local Democratic Party headquarters and had campaigned for Adlai Stevenson; in 1964, Olof was elected to a Democratic seat on the Manchester board of directors. “They were throwing fund-raising parties all the time,” Anderson recalls. She, in contrast, felt awkward and anxious. “Books were secure—this was something I could master and control.”"],["p","The reading led to other interests. “Everyone had something to teach her,” Laura Grande, a childhood friend, says. “She wasn’t interested in parties, or in social gatherings that weren’t enlightening.” Anderson dreamed of studying math and economics, because she loved the way they hung together in a tight system. At one point, Olof and Elizabeth read Plato’s Republic and Mill’s “On Liberty” together.

Friday afternoon, Anderson sat with Kimberly Chuang, a soft-spoken twenty-nine-year-old who had just defended her dissertation, the final rite of passage before the Ph.D. Chuang had devised a model for “contributive justice,” determining what people owe society, rather than what society owes them: a frameshift with implications for taxation. At the defense, five professors prodded her with questions in the manner of a dental scaler scraping away plaque—an excavation that Chuang seemed to enjoy in proportion. They deliberated, then issued good news. “You’re a doctor!” Anderson said. Everybody stood up and applauded."],["p","Anderson had invented a “Ph.D. to lecturer” program at Michigan, to give new doctors a grace year to teach and to apply for jobs, and Chuang was to be the inaugural fellow. Still, Chuang blanched as they discussed the scope of her new obligations. She had four classes to help teach, and was supposed to give talks at a slew of international conferences. How should she prepare these audition-like presentations?"],["p","“Don’t write up,” Anderson advised. “Just do PowerPoint slides.” Behind her, a PC was mounted on a treadmill desk; she tries to get in ten thousand steps a day. She went on, “Give the big picture, make points to motivate the idea, and punt all the objections to the Q. & A. What ensues is a very lively Q. & A.”"],["p","Chuang knitted her brow. An esteemed philosopher at Oxford reads his talks, she said."],["p","“Yeah, horrible,” Anderson said. “So retro.” The issue was that people were afraid of questions, and tried to address them all preëmptively. She laughed darkly: ",["em","Hhhh-aahr-aahr-aahr"],". “Philosophers are too risk averse, and this makes listening to philosophers ",["em","tedious"],".”"],["p","Anderson landed at Michigan out of graduate school, in 1987, and never left, despite being courted by other universities, starting with an “out of the blue” tenure-track job offer from Princeton the following year. Michigan, despite its winters, seemed a warmer place. The school was huge, but Anderson liked the size. (“For any subject I’m interested in—and I’m interested in a zillion things—I know there will be an expert who can lead me to essential sources,” she says.) Still, there were challenges. On her first day, a senior colleague took her to lunch—a friendly welcome, she assumed, until he started telling her his thoughts on why she was the only woman in the department. Then he lighted into Martha Nussbaum, who had taught her Plato at Harvard, and Nussbaum’s recent book “The Fragility of Goodness,” which had made her a star. Many people have doubted that women are capable of doing good philosophy, he mused, and this book offered no counterevidence. Anderson remembers, “I was, like, ",["em","Uh-oh"],".”"],["p","Until then, Anderson had never really considered the role of gender in her career. She later learned that there were fewer women in academic philosophy than in either math or astrophysics, and a sense of the way inequality was built into that pipeline propelled her interest in feminist philosophy. In 1993, she became the first woman in Michigan’s department to be tenured from within."],["p","Her first book, “Value in Ethics and Economics,” appeared that year, announcing one of her major projects: reconciling value (an amorphous ascription of worth that is a keystone of ethics and economics) with pluralism (the fact that people seem to value things in different ways). Philosophers have often assumed that pluralistic value reflects human fuzziness—we’re loose, we’re confused, and we mix rational thought with sentimental responses. Anderson proposed that, actually, pluralism of value wasn’t the fuzz but the thing itself. She offered an “expressive” theory: in her view, each person’s values could be various because they were socially expressed, and thus shaped by the range of contexts and relationships at play in a life. Instead of positing value as a basic, abstract quality across society (the way “utility” functioned for economists), she saw value",["inline-embed",{"type":"analytics","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22analytics%22%2C%22url%22%3A%225%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":""}]," as something determined by the details of an individual’s history. Like her idea of relational equality, this model resisted the temptation to flatten human variety toward a unifying standard. In doing so, it helped expand the realm of free and reasoned economic choice."],["p","Consider a couple who has worked for years to run a family restaurant and is offered a corporate buyout, worth more than they could earn by keeping it open. Traditional economists and many philosophers would say, Take the money! That would maximize value. Maybe you can use it to start a new restaurant. In Anderson’s expressive model, the couple might have a sound reason to refuse. “They did not work all those years to make millions for some brand-x corporation,” she wrote. “A concern for the narrative unity of their lives, for what meaning their present choices make of their past actions, could rationally motivate them to turn down the offer.” The value of that narrative unity was beyond the reach of the market: for that couple, no price was the right price."],["p","In this sense, “Value in Ethics and Economics” was partly about reclaiming moral authority from the cold-eyed neoclassical economists who guided policy in the eighties and nineties. Anderson’s model unseated the premises of rational-choice theory, in which individuals invariably make utility-maximizing decisions, occasionally in heartless-seeming ways. It ran with, rather than against, moral intuition. Because values were plural, it was perfectly rational to choose to spend evenings with your family, say, ",["em","and"]," have guilt toward the people you left in the lurch at work."],["p","The theory also pointed out the limits on free-market ideologies, such as libertarianism. In ethics, it broke across old factional debates. The core idea “has been picked up on by people across quite a range of positions,” Peter Railton, one of Anderson’s longtime colleagues, says. “Kantians and consequentialists alike”—people who viewed morality in terms of duties and obligations, and those who measured the morality of actions by their effects in the world—“could look at it and see something important.”"],["p","“She has this way of challenging the dominant model and assumptions in multiple areas,” Sally Haslanger, a former colleague of Anderson’s who is now at M.I.T., says. “She has that ability to turn the lens so that people who thought they knew the way to proceed are now seeing very different things.”"],["p","Part of the novelty in Anderson’s approach came from a shift in how she practiced philosophy. Traditionally, the discipline is taught through a-priori thought—you start with basic principles and reason forward. Anderson, by contrast, sought to work empirically, using information gathered from the world, identifying problems to be solved not abstractly but through the experienced problems of real people."],["p","Shortly after arriving at Michigan, she had been struck by the work of a law-school colleague, Don Herzog, which incorporated a turn-of-the-century school of American thought called pragmatism. To a pragmatist, “truth” is an instrumental and contingent state; a claim is true for now if, by all tests, it works for now. This approach, and the friendship that had borne it, enriched Anderson’s work. Herzog has offered notes on almost everything she has published in the past three decades."],["p","In 2004, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy asked Anderson to compose its entry on the moral philosophy of John Dewey, who helped carry pragmatist methods into the social realm. Dewey had an idea of democracy as a system of good habits that began in civil life. He was an anti-ideologue with an eye for pluralism. Anderson was quickly smitten. In 2013, when she was elevated to Michigan’s highest professorship and got to name her chair—a kind of academic spirit animal—she styled herself the John Dewey Distinguished University Professor. “Dewey argued that the primary problems for ethics in the modern world concerned the ways society ought to be organized, rather than personal decisions of the individual,” Anderson wrote in her Stanford Encyclopedia entry. As she turned to problems in her work and her life, his thought became a crucial guide."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EAnderson%20and%20her%20husband%20went%20to%20lunch%20at%20Zingerman%E2%80%99s%2C%20a%20deli%20restaurant%20in%20downtown%20Ann%20Arbor.%20It%20was%20a%20warm%20weekend%2C%20and%20Anderson%2C%20who%20had%20just%20come%20from%20a%20walk%20of%20a%20few%20thousand%20steps%20in%20the%20arboretum%2C%20ordered%20peaches%20with%20jalape%C3%B1o%20dressing%20and%20a%20bowl%20of%20gazpacho.%20Jacobi%2C%20who%20had%20come%20from%20a%20four-mile%20jog%2C%20got%20a%20brisket%20sandwich%2C%20fruit%20salad%2C%20and%20a%20Dr.%20Brown%E2%80%99s%20black-cherry%20soda.%20%E2%80%9CI%20should%20never%20come%20here%20after%20running%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20told%20the%20woman%20at%20the%20counter.%20(He%20often%20strikes%20up%20small%2C%20self-revealing%20conversations%20with%20people%20at%20registers.)%20Outside%2C%20they%20found%20a%20table%20in%20the%20shade.%20Anderson%20sat%2C%20and%20Jacobi%20put%20an%20arm%20around%20her.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3E%E2%80%9CI%E2%80%99ve%20got%20my%20love%20puppy%2C%E2%80%9D%20Anderson%20said.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EHe%20stiffened%20indignantly.%20%E2%80%9CYour%20love%20%3Cem%3Edog%3C%2Fem%3E%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3E%E2%80%9CMy%20nickname%20for%20him%2C%20depending%20on%20my%20mood%2C%20is%20Hundie%20or%20Hound%20Dog%E2%80%94or%20Doggie%2C%E2%80%9D%20Anderson%20explained.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22callout%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522callout%2522%252C%2522name%2522%253A%2522inset-left%2522%252C%2522body%2522%253A%2522%253Cinline-embed%2520type%253D%255C%2522cartoon%255C%2522%2520meta%253D%255C%2522%25257B%252522type%252522%25253A%252522cartoon%252522%25252C%252522url%252522%25253A%252522%25252Fcartoon%25252F5c1d1d1b1fa04b334bab0818%252522%25252C%252522width%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522height%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522caption%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25257D%255C%2522%2520ref%253D%255C%25225c1d1d1b1fa04b334bab0818%255C%2522%253E%253C%252Finline-embed%253E%2522%252C%2522attrs%2522%253A%257B%257D%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22%5C%22%3E%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5c1d1d1b1fa04b334bab0818%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225c1d1d1b1fa04b334bab0818%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%3Cp%3EAt%20sixty%2C%20Dave%20Jacobi%20has%20a%20college%20student%E2%80%99s%20narrow%20shoulders%2C%20a%20stubby%20beard%2C%20and%20glasses%20that%20magnify%20his%20eyes.%20He%20also%20has%20a%20stellar%20repertoire%20of%20doctorly%20self-deprecating%20jokes%20(%E2%80%9CAs%20a%20teen-ager%2C%20I%20wanted%20to%20be%20a%20moral%20hero%2C%20like%20Christ%20or%20Schweitzer%2C%20but%20now%20I%E2%80%99m%20aiming%20for%20law-abiding%E2%80%9D)%20and%20a%20gregariousness%20that%20tends%20to%20flatter%20his%20wife.%20Anderson%20is%20a%20genius%2C%20he%20says%2C%20while%20he%E2%80%99s%20a%20schmo.%20(He%20is%20actually%20a%20respected%20internist%20in%20the%20Henry%20Ford%20Health%20System%2C%20which%20serves%20all%20Detroit.)%20Their%20lives%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22analytics%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522analytics%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%25226%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%20today%20aren%E2%80%99t%20so%20much%20intertwined%20as%20subject%20to%20a%20division%20of%20labor.%20Jacobi%20purports%20to%20have%20no%20idea%20what%20his%20salary%20is%2C%20because%20Anderson%20keeps%20the%20family%20finances.%20He%20maintains%20the%20social%20calendar%2C%20because%20it%20might%20not%20otherwise%20occur%20to%20Anderson%20to%20leave%20her%20desk.%20At%20their%20first%20meeting%2C%20Anderson%20explained%20Hegel%E2%80%99s%20notion%20of%20self-alienated%20spirit.%20(%E2%80%9CThe%20thing%20is%2C%20not%20only%20did%20Liz%20explain%20it%20but%20it%20made%20sense%20to%20me%20for%20about%20an%20hour%2C%E2%80%9D%20Jacobi%20says.)%20On%20their%20honeymoon%2C%20in%20the%20Southwest%2C%20they%20hired%20a%20geologist%20to%20accompany%20them%20and%20lecture%20about%20rocks.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EYet%20they%20disagreed%20while%20raising%20their%20two%20children.%20As%20a%20toddler%2C%20their%20elder%20child%20was%20given%20to%20tantrums.%20Their%20younger%20child%20was%20diagnosed%20as%20being%20on%20the%20spectrum%3B%20Anderson%20took%20time%20off%20to%20work%20with%20him%20one-on-one.%20%E2%80%9COur%20kids%20had%20a%20certain%20degree%20of%20emotional%20disregulation%2C%20and%20Liz%20was%20unbelievably%20astute%20about%2C%20and%20willing%20to%20tolerate%2C%20being%20yelled%20at%20without%20escalating%20the%20emotion%20in%20return%2C%E2%80%9D%20Jacobi%20said.%20%E2%80%9CShe%20probably%

coincided with a transformation in Anderson’s methods. She started working with historians, trying to hone her understanding of ideas by studying them in the context of their creation. Take Rousseau’s apparent support of direct democracy. It’s rarely mentioned that, at the moment when he made that argument, his home town of Geneva had been taken over by oligarchs who claimed to represent the public. Pragmatism said that an idea was an instrument, which naturally gave rise to such questions as: an instrument for what, and where, and when?"],["p","Her approach broadened in other ways, too. In “What Is the Point of Equality?,” Anderson had already started to drift away from what philosophers, following Rawls, call ideal theory, based on an end vision for a perfectly just society. As Anderson began a serious study of race in America, though, she found herself losing faith in that approach entirely."],["p","Broadly, there’s a culturally right and a culturally left ideal theory for race and society. The rightist version calls for color blindness. Instead of making a fuss about skin and ethnicity, its advocates say, society should treat people as people, and let the best and the hardest working rise. The leftist theory envisions identity communities: for once, give black people (or women, or members of other historically oppressed groups) the resources and opportunities they need, including, if they want it, civil infrastructure for themselves. In “The Imperative of Integration,” published in 2010, Anderson tore apart both of these models. Sure, it might be nice to live in a color-blind society, she wrote, but that’s nothing like the one that exists. In one study she cited, sixty per cent of people who saw a crime report on TV that hadn’t identified the suspect thought that it had; seventy per cent of those people thought that the suspect was black. Other research found that when white people pretended not to notice race they often acquired alienating tics, such as avoiding eye contact. Color blindness would simply lock in problems past correction."],["p","But the case for self-segregation was also weak. Affinity groups provided welcome comfort, yet that wasn’t the same as power or equality, Anderson pointed out. And there was a goose-and-gander problem. Either you let only certain groups self-segregate (certifying their subordinate status) or you also permitted, say, white men to do it, and—well, we have a lot of data from that experiment, and they’re not encouraging."],["p","Anderson’s solution was “integration,” a concept that, especially in progressive circles, had been",["inline-embed",{"type":"analytics","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22analytics%22%2C%22url%22%3A%227%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":""}]," uncool since the late sixties. Integration, by her lights, meant mixing on the basis of equality. It was not assimilation. It required adjustments from all groups. Anderson laid out four integrative stages: formal desegregation (no legal separation), spatial integration (different people share neighborhoods), formal social integration (they work together, and are one another’s bosses), and informal social integration (they become buddies, get married, start families). Black students in integrated high schools, according to one study, had higher graduation rates than those in segregated schools, even controlling for socioeconomic background, parental education, and other factors. Students—black ",["em","and"]," white—at integrated schools went on to lead more integrated lives."],["p","Some philosophers of color welcomed the book. “She’s taking the need for racial justice seriously, and you could hardly find another white political philosopher over a period of decades doing that,” Charles Mills, a philosopher at the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"CUNY"]," Graduate Center, says. For others, though, a white woman making recommendations on race policy raised questions of perspective. She was engaging through a mostly white Anglo-American tradition. She worked from the premise that, because she drew on folders full of studies, the limits of her own perspective were not constraining. At the same time, in attending to these empirical findings over doctrine, she announced herself as a non-ideal theorist: a philosopher with no end vision of society. The approach recalls E. L. Doctorow’s description of driving at night: “You can see only as far as the headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way.”"],["p","An integrative project also makes demands of academic practice. “Liz has a genuine concern for fostering intellectual diversity,” Daniel Jacobson, the only philosopher in her department who identifies as conservative, says. (He hosts a symposium for right-of-center thought; she supports the endeavor and sometimes joins in.) Recently, Anderson changed the way she assigns undergraduate essays: instead of requiring students to argue a position and fend off objections, doubling down on their original beliefs, she asks them to discuss their position with someone who disagrees, and to explain how and why, if at all, the discussion changed their views. Michigan, which, since 1988, has run a Program on Intergroup Relations, has avoided many of the impasses around identity and speech that have unsettled campuses elsewhere. “It’s not like there’s no racial politics,” Anderson says. “There’s lots of racial politics, but people are talking to one another.”"],["p","Anderson’s closest contact with a firestorm came last year, when ",["em","Hypatia"],", a feminist philosophy journal on whose board she sat, was pressured to retract an article exploring similarities between Caitlyn Jenner’s gender transition and Rachel Dolezal’s identification as a black woman. The board ultimately stood by its publication, with a statement rich in Andersonian language. “The Board affirms ",["em","Hypatia’s"]," commitment to pluralist inquiry,” it read. The suggestion was that ",["em","how"]," you are, not who you are, supplies a legitimate basis for social action."],["p","In certain ways, this style of thinking is at odds with current modes. Derrick Darby, a philosopher who grew up in the Queensbridge projects, in New York City, and is the only tenured black professor in Anderson’s department, works in the Michigan-school mold, drawing heavily on empirical research. He taught “The Imperative of Integration” in dialogue with his own data-based critique. “Ideas of racial hierarchy will play out in different ways even within an integrated context,” he says. “Black and brown kids are disproportionately assigned to special education. There’s tracking that still goes on.” But his personal experience made him chary, too. “Liz has a view that you pull people up from the projects and send them on their ways into the élite,” he says. As someone who’d made that journey, he thought she underweighted the constraints—the unfreedom—involved in being “the only damn black person in so many rooms.” At one point, Anderson visited Darby’s class. “We spoke about our experiences,” he recalls, “and why it led us to focus our work as we did”: childhood for him and parenting for her. They both ended up in

challenge of pluralism is the challenge of modern society: maintaining equality amid difference in a culture given to constant and unpredictable change. It is the fashion in America these days to define political virtue by position. Richard is on the side of history, we might say, because he’s to the left of Irma on this issue and slightly to the right of Marco on that one. Anderson would resist this way of thinking, not least because it calls for intellectual convergence. It’s anti-pluralistic and tribalist. It celebrates ideology; it presumes that certain models have absolute, not situational, value. Rather than fighting for the ascendancy of certain positions, Anderson suggests, citizens should fight to bolster healthy institutions and systems—those which insure that all views and experiences will be heard. Today’s righteous projects, after all, will inevitably seem fatuous and blinkered from the vantage of another age."],["p","By some measures, the late nineteen-sixties was a time when liberalism’s standing as an American creed, while appearing to intensify, frayed. It was, especially from the perspective of Anderson’s childhood, an era characterized by ideological aggression: campus uprisings and urban riots, assassinations and increasingly fruitless debates. “The world was falling apart,” she says, channelling her parents’ perception at the time.

Some years ago, she began to envisage a comprehensive history of egalitarianism. How did egalitarian ideas emerge, and how had they changed? How did they relate to ideas about the uses and abuses of state power?"],["p","“Originally, I thought, I’ll start mid-seventeenth century,” she said. “But then you realize, well, you can’t really deal with that until you deal with the Protestant radicals of the Reformation, like the Anabaptists. But the Anabaptists are harking back to early Christian egalitarian communities—so maybe I have to start looking at, like, the New Testament. ",["em","Hah-hah-hah!"],"” Eventually, Anderson ended up at the hunter-gatherers. It occurred to her that hundreds of thousands of years might be a lot to cover in one book, so she decided that it would be two books, or three. Possibly five. Regardless, it will take her a while to finish, maybe the rest of her life. But it will be her big project, the unified picture that she leaves behind."],["p","Anderson was invited to deliver the Tanner Lectures at Princeton in 2015, and decided to launch the project there. Many people still believed that market economies were a sound foundation of freedom. Yet, she found, ninety per cent of female restaurant workers reported being sexually harassed. Some poultry-industry employees were said to have worn diapers for lack of breaks. About seven million American workers had been compelled to support political positions under threat from their bosses. Such people could not be called free."],["p","Anderson zeroed in on Adam Smith, whose “The Wealth of Nations,” published in 1776, is taken as a keystone of free-market ideology. At the time, English labor was subject to uncompensated apprenticeships, domestic servitude, and some measure of clerical dominion. Rigid hierarchies, from the king to the pauper, were maintained by an arcane system of debts, favors, and gifts. Smith saw the markets as an escape from that order. Their “most important” function, he explained, was to bring “liberty and security” to those “who had before lived almost in a continual state of war with their neighbours, and of servile dependency upon their superiors.”"],["p","Smith, in other words, was an egalitarian. He had written “The Wealth of Nations” in no small part to be a solution to what we’d now call structural inequality—the intractable, compounding privileges of an arbitrary hierarchy. It was a historical irony that, a century later, writers such as Marx pointed to the market as a structure of dominion over workers; in truth, Smith and Marx had shared a socioeconomic project. And yet Marx had not been wrong to trash Smith’s ideas, because, during the time between them, the world around Smith’s model had changed, and it was no longer a useful tool."],["p","“The Industrial Revolution was a cataclysmic event for egalitarians,” Anderson explains in “Private Government” (2017), a book that she assembled from the Tanner Lectures.

Defenders of this state of affairs often counter that people negotiate their salaries and can always leave. Anderson notes that low-level workers can rarely wrangle raises, and that real-world constraints eliminate exit power.

If you’re a brilliant potter, and people want to pay you more than the next guy for your pottery, great! (If you’re just O.K. but want to work extra industriously for the difference, that’s fair, too.) The problem isn’t that talent and income are distributed in unequal parcels. The problem is that Jeff Bezos earns more than a hundred thousand dollars a minute, while Amazon warehouse employees, many talented and hardworking, have reportedly resorted to urinating in bottles in lieu of a bathroom break. That circumstance reflects some structure of hierarchical oppression.

And we shouldn’t commit ourselves to an ideal system of any sort, whether socialist or libertarian, because a model set in motion like a Swiss watch will become a trap as soon as circumstances change.

lecture at Ohio State University was called “The Great Reversal: How Neoliberalism Turned the Economic Aspirations of Liberalism Upside Down.” The three-hundred-seat Ohio Union theatre was near capacity that afternoon. Anderson came to the lectern in her flowing black ensemble and noisily cleared her throat into the microphone. A wage-and-productivity graph appeared on a screen behind her. She had prepared a PowerPoint."],["p","“You can see that, from about 1950 to 1970, the typical American’s wages kept up with productivity growth,” she said. Then, around 1974, she went on, hourly compensation stagnated.

Anderson rattled off a constellation of factors, from strengthened intellectual-property law to winnowed antitrust law. Financialization, deregulation. Plummeting taxes on capital alongside rising payroll taxes. Privatization, which exchanged modest public-sector salaries for C.E.O. paydays. She gazed into the audience and blinked. “So now we have to ask: What has been used to justify this rather dramatic shift of labor-share of income?” she said."],["p","The answer, of course, was classical liberal philosophers.

The classical liberals had been anti-monopolistic. “They opposed all forms of unfree labor—not just slavery but serfdom, peonage, unpaid apprenticeship,” she said, peering at some undergraduates in front."],["p","While spending the summer researching the history of the Protestant work ethic for her Seeley Lectures, at Cambridge, this spring, Anderson had come across a rarely collected essay by Jeremy Bentham, who was born twenty-five years after Smith. Bentham is widely known for coming up with the idea for a creepy surveillance prison, the panopticon, which Michel Foucault much later turned into a metaphor for institutional control. Anderson found that, in this obscure essay, “Pauper Management Improved: Particularly by Means of an Application of the Panopticon Principle of Construction,” Bentham had himself proposed that panopticons be used to manage not just criminals but also the poor, the elderly, and the disabled. “He projected that this model would be really great for everyone, but especially for the owner of the panopticon,” Anderson told the audience in Ohio. “He had detailed calculations. You could get three-hundred-per-cent profits from an adult man and two-hundred-per-cent profits from an adult woman. But the greatest source of profits of all”—she paused—“would come from child labor.”"],["p","Behind Anderson, a slide of Bentham’s quasi-mummified body appeared. She grew visibly excited. “ ‘Pauper Management Improved,’ I think, is one of the ",["em","original"]," sources of the arguments for the privatization of public functions,” she said. It was no wonder that industrial-age thinking was riddled with contradictions: it reflected what Anderson called “the plutocratic reversal” of classical liberal ideas. Those perversely reversed ideas about freedom were the ones that found a home in U.S. policy, and, well, here we were."],["p","Anderson followed up with an ebullient Q. & A., and then was taken to the faculty club for dinner.

The author’s first novel, the post-colonial classic “Nervous Conditions” (1988), followed Tambu, a woman in nineteen-sixties Rhodesia who is striving for an education in order to transcend a village upbringing. Here, in the third novel of a trilogy, Tambu faces breakdowns and the realization that her hard-won achievements do not guarantee upward mobility in a Zimbabwe beset by poverty, autocracy, and white privilege. Desperate for money, having quit a job where she received “miserly wages for copy white men put their names to,” she works for a tour company that offers wealthy European tourists an authentic African experience. Soon she is guiding them around her old village. The novel brilliantly dramatizes the tragic ironies of life in a country where keeping yourself afloat may mean swallowing your pride."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22feature-small%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22callout%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522callout%2522%252C%2522name%2522%253A%2522inset-left%2522%252C%2522body%2522%253A%2522%253Cinline-embed%2520type%253D%255C%2522image%255C%2522%2520meta%253D%255C%2522%25257B%252522type%252522%25253A%252522image%252522%25252C%252522url%252522%25253A%252522%25252Fphotos%25252F5c1ae13681ab3335f580def6%252522%25252C%252522width%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522height%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522caption%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25257D%255C%2522%2520ref%253D%255C%25225c1ae13681ab3335f580def6%255C%2522%253E%253C%252Finline-embed%253E%2522%252C%2522attrs%2522%253A%257B%257D%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22%5C%22%3E%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5c1ae13681ab3335f580def6%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225c1ae13681ab3335f580def6%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5c1ae13681ab3335f580def6%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225c1ae13681ab3335f580def6%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"image","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22image%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fphotos%2F5c1ae13681ab3335f580def6%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5c1ae13681ab3335f580def6"}]]],["p",["strong","The Lonesome Bodybuilder"],["em",", by Yukiko Motoya, translated from the Japanese by Asa Yoneda (Soft Skull)"],". The mundane and the magical are kneaded into one throughout this collection of stories: a husband made of straw orders a latte, a girl next door grows pink hair and cries tears of blood, a customer goes into a fitting room and doesn’t reëmerge. In this alien yet familiar world, invisible forces assume physical shapes: two lovers become identical to each other; girlfriends develop features desired by their boyfriends. The monstrous plots prompt human queries: Does getting comfortable in a relationship involve a loss of self? Is one’s identity bounded by one’s surroundings? “I’ve only been doing what everyone else was doing already—impersonating me,” one character writes."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22feature-small%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22callout%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522callout%2522%252C%2522name%2522%253A%2522inset-left%2522%252C%2522body%2522%253A%2522%253Cinline-embed%2520type%253D%255C%2522image%255C%2522%2520meta%253D%255C%2522%25257B%252522type%252522%25253A%252522image%252522%25252C%252522url%252522%25253A%252522%25252Fphotos%25252F5c1ad94536cecf4019212e2f%252522%25252C%252522width%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522height%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522caption%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25257D%255C%2522%2520ref%253D%255C%25225c1ad94536cecf4019212e2f%255C%2522%253E%253C%252Finline-embed%253E%2522%252C%2522attrs%2522%253A%257B%257D%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22%5C%22%3E%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5c1ad94536cecf4019212e2f%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225c1ad94536cecf4019212e2f%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5c1ad94536cecf4019212e2f%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225c1ad94536cecf4019212e2f%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"image","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22image%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fphotos%2F5c1ad94536cecf4019212e2f%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5c1ad94536cecf4019212e2f"}]]],["p",["strong","Tigerland"],["em",", by Wil Haygood (Knopf)"],". At the center of this social history is the championship runs, in 1968 and 1969, of basketball and baseball teams from East High School, in Columbus, Ohio. Haygood’s game-by-game narrative expands to encompass the story of the black residents of Columbus’s East Side, including the poverty and segregation that shaped the players on those teams. No detail seems too small to include—for instance, the number of minutes the school’s principal played for Ohio State’s football team before making a fortuitous interception—but the factoids coalesce to produce a vivid sense of the community’s deep identification with its sports team. “East High represented more than just the school,” Haygood writes. “It was a vibrant part of the black community at large.”"],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22feature-small%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22callout%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522callout%2522%252C%2522name%2522%253A%2522inset-left%2522%252C%2522body%2522%253A%2522%253Cinline-embed%2520type%253D%255C%2522image%255C%2522%2520meta%253D%255C%2522%25257B%252522type%252522%25253A%252522image%252522%25252C%252522url%252522%25253A%252522%25252Fphotos%25252F5c1ae136d2db9849ec9e4263%252522%25252C%252522width%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522height%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522caption%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25257D%255C%2522%2520ref%253D%255C%25225c1ae136d2db9849ec9e4263%255C%2522%253E%253C%252Finline-embed%253E%2522%252C%2522attrs%2522%253A%257B%257D%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22%5C%22%3E%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5c1ae136d2db9849ec9e4263%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225c1ae136d2db9849ec9e4263%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5c1ae136d2db9849ec9e4263%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225c1ae136d2db9849ec9e4263%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"image","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22image%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fphotos%2F5c1ae136d2db9849ec9e4263%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5c1ae136d2db9849ec9e4263"}]]],["p",["strong","Hungover"],["em",", by Shaughnessy Bishop-Stall (Penguin Books)"],". This unabashedly droll account of the author’s search for a hangover cure posits a hangover taxonomy (seven kinds, including “the Creeper” and “the Burrower”); assesses hangover literature from Pliny the Elder to Kingsley Amis; and recalls the experience of flying a fighter plane after a boozy night. As Bishop-Stall tests remedies that include intravenous drips and voodoo, his practical quest leads to a kind of metaphysics of the hangover. When he comes across a cure that works, he is unnerved: “I became like a man scared of himself, yet undaunted by the

is a mug’s game. But then, lately, most of us are mugs. 2018 was a banner year for the art of prediction, which is not to say the science, because there really is no science of prediction. Predictive algorithms start out as historians: they study historical data to detect patterns. Then they become prophets: they devise mathematical formulas that explain the pattern, test the formulas against historical data withheld for the purpose, and use the formulas to make predictions about the future. That’s why Amazon, Google, Facebook, and everyone else are collecting your data to feed to their algorithms: they want to turn your past into your future."],["p","This task, like most things, used to be done by hand. In 1968, the Foreign Policy Association, formed in 1918 to promote the League of Nations, celebrated its fiftieth anniversary by publishing a book of predictions about what the world would look like, technology-wise, fifty years on. “Toward the Year 2018” was edited by Emmanuel G. Mesthene, who had served in the White House as an adviser on science and technology and who ran Harvard’s Program on Technology and Society. It makes for distressing reading at the end of 2018, a year that, a golden anniversary ago, looked positively thrilling."],["p","Two things are true about “Toward the Year 2018.” First, most of the machines that people expected would be invented have, in fact, been invented. Second, most of those machines have had consequences wildly different from those anticipated in 1968. It’s bad manners to look at past predictions to see if they’ve come true. Still, if history is any guide, today’s futurists have very little credibility. An algorithm would say the same."],["p","Carlos R. DeCarlo, the director of automation research at I.B.M., covered computers in the book, predicting that, in 2018, “machines will do more of man’s work, but will force man to think more logically.” DeCarlo was consistently half right. He correctly anticipated miniature computers (“very small, portable storage units”), but wrongly predicted the coming of a universal language (“very likely a modified and expanded form of English”). One thing he got terribly wrong: he expressed tragically unfounded confidence that “the political and social institutions of the United States will remain flexible enough to ingest the fruits of science and technology without basic damage to its value systems.”"],["p","Reporting on the future of communication, J. R. Pierce, from Bell Labs, explained that “the Bell System is committed to the provision of a Picturephone service commercially in the early 1970s,” and that, by 2018, face-to-face communication across long distances would be available everywhere: “The transmission of pictures and texts and the distant manipulation of computers and other machines will be added to the transmission of the human voice on a scale that will eventually approach the universality of telephony.” True! “What all this will do to the world I cannot guess,” Pierce admitted, with becoming modesty. “It seems bound to affect us all.”"],["p","Sharp-eyed observers in 1968 were already concerned about the warming of the oceans and the changing of the climate, but the atmospheric-science contributor to “Toward the Year 2018,” Thomas F. Malone, was excited by new technologies that would allow scientists to take control of the earth’s weather and climate. Malone served as the chairman of the Committee on Atmospheric Sciences of the National Academy of Sciences, which, in 1966, had issued a report endorsing “a long-range program of weather control and climate modification,” to be implemented by way of manipulating fog, cloud-seeding, and the “suppression of lightning.” He thought “the probability of success in broad climate modification is likely to exceed 50 percent by the year 2018.” Standing in the way of this objective, he warned, were political obstacles—the international coöperation required for a global climate-change program—and the possibility that, before such a thing could be fully executed, “large-scale climate modification will be effected inadvertently,” because, he had to admit, it appeared that the climate was already changing all on its own. “Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere since 1900 has caused surface temperatures to rise 0.2 degrees C,” he acknowledged, hastening to reassure his readers that, while global temperatures could conceivably keep rising all the way to 2018, there was only “a small probability that these effects will not be tolerable.”"],["p","The only real doomsayer was the demographer Philip M. Hauser. He calculated that, by 2018, the world’s population would reach 9.7 billion (he was two billion over), with the steepest growth in Asia and Latin America, and the slowest in Europe. Also, that the distance between the rich and the poor, and between wealthy nations and poor nations, would widen. “Given the present outlook, only the faithful who believe in miracles from heaven, the optimistic who anticipate superwonders from science, the parochial fortunate who think they can continue to exist on islands of affluence in a sea of world poverty, and the naïve who anticipate nothing can look to the future with equanimity,” Hauser concluded."],["p","But the most prescient contributor to “Toward the Year 2018” was the M.I.T. political scientist Ithiel de Sola Pool, whose research interests included social networks and computer simulation. “By 2018 it will be cheaper to store information in a computer bank than on paper,” Pool wrote. “Tax returns, social security records, census forms, military records, perhaps a criminal record, hospital rec-ords, security clearance files, school transcripts . . . bank statements, credit ratings, job records,” and more would, by 2018, be stored on computers that could communicate with one another over a vast international network. You could find out anything about anyone, without ever leaving your desk. “By 2018 the researcher sitting at his console will be able to compile a cross-tabulation of consumer purchases (from store records) by people of low IQ (from school records) who have an unemployed member of the family (from social security records). That is, he will have the technological capability to do this.

night before his ninety-fifth-birthday party, my father fell while turning around in his kitchen. My sister Lisa and her husband, Bob, dropped by hours later to hook up his new TV and discovered him on the floor, disoriented and in pain. He fell again after they righted him, so an ambulance was called. At the hospital, they met up with our sister Gretchen, and with Amy, who’d just flown in from New York to attend the party, which was now cancelled. “It was really weird,” she said when we spoke on the phone the following morning. “Dad thought Lisa was Mom, and when the doctor asked him where he was he answered, ‘Syracuse’—where he went to college. Then he got mad and said, ‘You’re sure asking a lot of questions.’ As if that’s not normal for a doctor. I think he thought this was just ",["em","some guy"]," he was talking to.”"],["p","Fortunately, he was lucid again by the following afternoon. That was the hard part for everyone—seeing him so confused."],["p","On the night that my father fell, I was in Princeton, the fourth of eighty cities I would be travelling to for work. On the morning he was moved from the hospital to a rehabilitation center, I was on my way to Ann Arbor. Over the next week, he had a few little strokes, the sort people don’t notice right away. One affected his peripheral vision, and another his short-term memory. He’d wanted to return home after leaving rehab, but by this point there was no way he could continue to live alone. I wrote him a letter, saying, in part, “It isn’t safe for you at the house anymore, at least not on your own, and this concerns me. I need you to live long enough to see Donald Trump impeached.”"],["p","We’d fought bitterly after the election, and I knew it would be just my luck: my father would die, and the very next day the President would go down, denying me a well-deserved opportunity to gloat."],["p","I’m not sure where I was when my father moved into his retirement home. Springmoor, it’s called. I saw it, finally, four months after his fall, when Hugh and I flew to North Carolina. It was early August, and we arrived to find him in an easy chair, blood flowing from his ear at what seemed to me like a pretty alarming rate. It looked fake, like beet juice, and was being dabbed at by a nurse’s assistant. “Oh, hello,” my father said, his voice soft and weary-sounding."],["p","I thought he didn’t know who I was, but then he added my name and held out his hand. “David.” He looked behind me. “Hugh.” Someone had wrapped his head with gauze, and when he leaned back he resembled the late English poet Edith Sitwell, very distinguished-looking, almost imperious. His eyebrows were thin and barely perceptible. It was the same with his lashes. I guess that, like the hairs on his arms and legs, they just got tired of holding on."],["p","“So what happened?” I asked, though I already knew. Lisa had told me that morning on the phone that his grandfather clock had fallen on him. It was made of walnut and bronze and had an abstract human face on it, surrounded by numbers that were tilted at odd angles. My mother always referred to it as Mr. Creech, after the artist who made it, but my dad calls it Father Time."],["p","I’d said to Hugh after hanging up with Lisa, “When you’re ninety-five, and Father Time ",["em","literally"]," knocks you to the ground, don’t you think he’s maybe trying to tell you something?”"],["p","“He insisted on moving it himself,” the woman attempting to stanch the bleeding said, “and it cut his ear. We sent him to the hospital for stitches, but now it’s started up again, maybe because he’s on blood thinners, so we’ve called an ambulance.” She raised her voice, even though my father is not hard of hearing. “HAVEN’T WE, LOU? HAVEN’T WE CALLED AN AMBULANCE?!”"],["p","At that moment, two E.M.T. workers came in, both young and bearded, like lumberjacks. Each took an elbow and helped my father to stand."],["p","“Are we going somewhere?” he asked."],["p","“BACK TO THE HOSPITAL!” the woman shouted."],["p","“All right,” my father said. “O.K.”"],["p","They wheeled him out, and the woman explained that, while the staff would remove bloodstains from the carpet, it was the family’s job to get them off any privately owned furniture. “I can bring you some towels,” she suggested."],["p","A few moments later, another aide walked into the room. “Excuse me,” she said, “but are you the famous son?”"],["p","“I’m a pretty sorry excuse for famous,” I told her. “But, yes, I’m his son.”"],["p","“So you’re Dave? Dave Chappelle? Can I have your autograph? Actually, can I have two?”"],["p","“Um, sure,” I said."],["p","I’d just joined Hugh in cleaning the easy chair when the woman, who seemed slightly nervous, the way you might be around a world-famous comedian who is young and black and has his whole life ahead of him, returned for two more autographs."],["p","“I’m the worst son in the world,” I told her, reaching for the scraps of paper she was holding out. “My father fell on April 7th, and this is the first time I’ve visited, the first time I’ve ",["em","talked"]," to him, even.”"],["p","“You put yourself down too much,” the woman said. “Just pick up the phone every so often—that’s what I do with my mother.” She offered a forgiving smile. “You can make that second autograph to my supervisor.” And she gave me a name."],["p","The blood on our wet rags looked even faker than the blood I’d watched falling from my father’s ear. I took a few halfhearted swipes at the easy chair, but it was Hugh who did most of the work. Mainly, I looked at the things my dad had decorated his room with: Father Time, a number of the streetscapes he and my mother bought in the seventies, rocks he’d carried back from fishing trips, each with a date and the name of the river it had come from written on it. All of it was so depressing to me. Then again, even a unicorn would have looked dingy in this place. I don’t know if it was the lighting, or the height of the ceiling. Perhaps it was the hospital bed against the wall, or the floor-length curtains that looked as if they’d come from a funeral parlor. Down the hall, a dozen or so residents, most in wheelchairs and some drooling onto bibs, were watching “",["em",{"class":"small"},"M*A*S*H"],"” on television."],["p","I couldn’t help but think of Mayview, the nursing home my father put his mother in, back in the mid-seventies. It seemed like only yesterday that I’d gone with him to see her. If now here ",["em","I"]," was, visiting him in a similar place, wouldn’t it be me, in the blink of an eye, in my own retirement center, ",["em","me"]," the frail widower reduced to a single room? Only I won’t have children to look after me, the way my father has Lisa, who had been extraordinary, and my brother Paul and Amy and Gretchen.

that afternoon, for the fourth time that week, Hugh saw someone taking pictures of our house. “I think they read your last book,” he said. “See!” I shouted to Harrison in the next room."],["p","He was into his game and didn’t answer."],["p","“They’re most likely just taking pictures of the Sea Section sign,” I said to Hugh. “It ",["em","is"]," a pretty good name for a beach house.” I then told him about a place our neighbor Bermey had mentioned that was farther up the coast and was called You Didn’t Get This, Bitch. “That probably gets photographed as well,” I said, “especially by divorced men.”"],["p","The picture-taking on the street side of our house was nothing compared with what was going on out back. When I was young, sea turtles would lay their eggs on the beach, and no one thought much about it. Now, though, it’s a huge deal."],["p","Loggerheads are on bumper stickers and signs. They’re an attraction, like the wild horses near Ocracoke. The spot where the eggs are laid is marked, and when the time arrives for them to hatch a team of volunteers from the Turtle Patrol is dispatched."],["p","A bright-yellow stake had been driven into the sand near the foot of the wooden staircase that led from our house to the beach, and, the morning after the boys arrived, volunteers dug a trench that would make it easier for the hatchlings to find the ocean. Now it was lined on either side with folding chairs, and the Turtle Patrol nest-sitting. I said to Hugh, “It’s like the red carpet at the Academy Awards.”"],["p","People walking down the beach, seeing the yellow caution tape and the trench watched over by do-gooders in bright Turtle Patrol T-shirts, wandered over to ask questions, and the crowd grew. At night, they’d sit with infrared flashlights, intently staring down, watching for the slightest movement, with their cameras at the ready."],["p","“It’s actually called a ",["em","boil"],",” Kathy told me. “That’s because when the eggs hatch, and the babies claw their way to the surface, the sand churns.”"],["p","“Isn’t that exciting?” I said to the boys."],["p","“Uh-huh,” they answered. “Sure.”"],["p","“Really?” I said. “You’re not interested in nature?” When I was their age, it was pretty much all I cared about—that and stealing and spying on people. I told them about the hideous-looking silver possum that had climbed up the front stairs of the house last Thanksgiving. “We fed her fruit and leftovers, and you should have seen the way her hands grabbed the food, almost like a human. Every night she came.”"],["p","Austin politely but vacantly said, “Wow.”"],["p","The only way to get the boys’ attention was by throwing one of the stink bombs I’d bought a week earlier, on Cape Cod. I’d thought the smell would be negligible—maybe like an old sock—but instead it cleared not just the room where the boys were playing Mario Kart but an entire side of the house. It was sulfur, for the most part, what I imagine Satan’s bathroom would smell like after he’d been on the toilet with the ",["em","National Review"]," for a while."],["p","“Goddammit,” Hugh said, holding his nose and opening the front and back doors, letting the hot, humid air in. “And we have company coming!”"],["p","“Why you . . . book writer,” Harrison scolded. He was wearing Minecraft pajamas and looked like a male model who’d been put into a machine and made small."],["p","Of the two brothers, Austin had the sweeter temperament. He’d ask questions and offer to help out. His voice had an old-fashioned quality to it, like a boy’s in a radio serial. “Gee willikers!” you could imagine him saying, if that were the name of a video game in which things blew up and women got shot in the back of the head."],["p","Compared with other kids I’ve known, the two were actually pretty good. Both liked fish, and they always ate everything on their plates. Rarely did they bicker, and when they did it was over within a minute or two. There was no crying, and, better still, no sulking. That, to me, is unbearable. “Oh, move on, for God’s sake,” my mother used to say when we glared and stewed, vowing to never forget the injustice of egg salad, or potato chips that were from the bottom of the bag, and broken."],["p","The boys weren’t terribly interested in the turtle boil taking place in back of the house, but I thought they might change their minds if they saw the baby loggerheads.

The day before his fall, he’d driven to the gym, not knowing that it was his last time behind the wheel of a car, his last night in his own bed. There would be a lot of that in his immediate future: the last time he could dress himself, the last time he could walk."],["p","I worried that he had entered a period when it would be one thing after another, death by a thousand cuts: a fall, a stroke, an accident with a grandfather clock. That’s how it was with the other extremely old people I’ve known in my life: the woman across the road from us in Normandy, our next-door neighbor in London. Phyllis Diller. Late in her life, the two of us became friends. She lived in a mansion in Brentwood, and each time I’d visit her there she’d be a bit less able; her eyes wouldn’t stop watering, or she couldn’t get up from a chair without help. Phyllis was lucky in that she could remain at home, and hire round-the-clock help; lucky, too, that she was famous—a legend by any definition.

Prawer was born in Cologne in 1927 into a bourgeois, assimilated Jewish family. Her maternal grandfather was a cantor at a prominent Cologne synagogue; her father, Marcus, a lawyer, had emigrated from Poland during the Great War. Ruth entered school the year Hitler came to power; she walked there to taunts of “Jew, Jew,” and had things thrown at her. In 1934, her father looked into emigrating to Palestine, but her mother resisted, certain that conditions in Germany would improve. It was only in April, 1939, that the family escaped to England. At the end of the war, they learned that more than forty relatives had been murdered in the camps. To those losses would be added one more: her father, broken by the news, killed himself in 1948."],["p","Ruth was by then a student of English literature at Queen Mary College, in London. When she was just six, she had had an epiphany after being asked to write a composition in school about a rabbit. “I wrote the title, ",["em","Der Hase"],",” she recounted in a lecture. “At once I was flooded with my destiny; only I didn’t know that’s what it was. I only remember my entire absorption, delight, in writing about—giving my impression of—",["em","der Hase."]," To think that such happiness could be!” After that, she wrote ceaselessly, stuffing cupboards “full with unfinished novels, plays, stories”; from her teens, she wrote in English, which she came to consider her “first language.” While her elder brother, Siegbert, studied Modern Languages at Cambridge (he went on to become a distinguished scholar of German literature), she produced an M.A. thesis on “The Short Story in England, 1700-1750.” It’s a telling sign of affinity for a form she would come to excel at."],["p","At a party in 1949, Ruth met Cyrus Jhabvala, an Indian Parsi architect who had come to England a few years earlier to study. Jhabvala had already bought his ticket home, but by the time he set sail for India he and Ruth were engaged. Two years later, having secured a job lecturing on architecture at Delhi Polytechnic, he came back to England to marry her, and the couple settled in Delhi."],["p","From Austerity Britain, where “everything was pretty basic and grim and grey,” the new Mrs. Jhabvala found herself transported to a “grand fairy land, full of sights and sounds and colors,” as she related in a later interview. There were exotic flowers, birds, and smells; captivating music performed by female vocalists “who for me were somehow an expression of everything a woman artist does”; and sweets that she consumed by the pound, “the essence of all sweetness that there ever could be.”"],["p","Jhabvala’s early fiction sauntered into middle-class Hindu households and wryly took the measure of their dramatic capacity: shy newlyweds and demanding mothers-in-law, pompous patresfamilias, feckless sons, and snooping aunties. The opening stories of “At the End of the Century” introduce Jhabvala’s remarkable economy of expression, devoid of sandalwood-scented, curry-flavored, bangle-clanging exoticism. Jhabvala sketches character, and by implication plot, in a few quick flicks, as in a tale of two rivalrous brothers, the elder “with his silk suit, his big ring, his oiled and scented hair,” and the younger “puny and insignificant,” who works as a shop attendant “with just the right mixture of dignity and obsequiousness.”"],["p","If Jhabvala has an anthropologist’s curiosity about how society functions, she’s a decidedly nonparticipant observer; her narrative stance brings together candor and detachment. She’s unsparing about the constraints and the tedium of women’s lives, for instance, but also about the women who are leading them. The wife of a devoted elderly aristocrat, trapped among “provincial, dreary, unrefined people,” seeks diversion in the arms of an abusive local policeman. A young widow manages to resist the gestures of self-abnegation expected by her late husband’s family, and pursues corporeal indulgences “not for pleasure, but compulsively, sunk in sloth and greed because soft beds and foods were all that life had given to her.” In “A Course of English Studies,” Jhabvala delivers an astute portrait of an upper-class Indian woman in England whose feeling of cultural dislocation hinges as much on her own sense of entitlement as on her loneliness and unfamiliarity."],["p","Anita Desai notes in the introduction to this collection that it was Jhabvala’s “fate to be presented to Western readers as a Jane Austen.” Jhabvala’s prose does share Austen’s acerbic wit and a well-cadenced fluency, confident in the strength of syntax to sustain explication—and comedy—without flashy language. As a screenwriter, Jhabvala learned to write with still greater economy. (“One sentence in a film is like, you know, fifteen or twenty sentences in a book,” she once said.) Her best novels are short, and her short stories are often better."],["p","What the Austen analogy doesn’t capture is Jhabvala’s role as a preëminent social historian of newly independent India. Neither English nor Indian (nor even truly Anglophone before adolescence), Jhabvala came to her subjects without being trailed by the shadow of empire. Her ability to make fiction out of the bourgeois Indian everyday was revelatory to younger post-colonial writers such as Desai, for whom Jhabvala was “the first one who was writing about my world, our world.”"],["p","Jhabvala also chronicled a distinctive phase in encounters between Indians and Westerners, as a last generation of imperial Britons trickled away and new customs, new tastes, and new people (increasingly American) stepped in. This is movingly captured in the 1965 Merchant Ivory film “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Shakespeare-Wallah-Shashi-Kapoor/dp/B07BTCS5ZT/ref=sr_1_1?s=instant-video&ie=UTF8&qid=1545416269&sr=1-1&keywords=Shakespeare+Wallah"},"Shakespeare Wallah"],",” Jhabvala’s first original screenplay. The movie follows a British family’s acting company as it tours India performing Shakespeare to dwindling audiences. Early in the film, the troupe encounters an itinerant monkey trainer who laments that people no longer care for his art. “Our story exactly,” one of the actors murmurs. Jhabvala’s script was inspired by the 1947 diaries of a real-life actor-manager, Geoffrey Kendal, but its brilliance lies in her turning what could have been a nostalgic period piece about the end of empire into a coming-of-age tale centered on the family’s teen-age daughter.

nineteen-sixties brought a new wave of ebullient Westerners to India to “find themselves,” and Jhabvala was waiting with a skewer. “Which Yoga do you do? Hatha Yoga or Bhakti Yoga or what?” a European seeker asks the Indian hero of “The Householder.” None, he confesses. “Well you should,” she chides. “How do you think you’ll meet the Eternal and the Infinite if you don’t?”"],["p","Many of Jhabvala’s novels and stories feature credulous Westerners (usually female) in thrall to charismatic Indian gurus (invariably male). Jhabvala generally musters a flicker of sympathy for those who know not what they do. In the story “A Spiritual Call,” we learn that Daphne “had always been known as straightforward and sensible, good at sickbeds, had done history at Oxford, wore tasteful, unobtrusive, English clothes. Yet when she met Swamiji she knew without a word being spoken that he meant her to follow him back to India.” This will not end well for her. In Jhabvala’s fiction, gurus are, to a man, grifting, lecherous, manipulative—and successful. “ ‘I have many warm invitations from America,’ Swamiji said. ‘From California especially.’ ”"],["p","Jhabvala made a comedy out of these encounters in her 1969 screenplay for “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Guru-Rita-Tushingham/dp/B01BL1FD4E/ref=sr_1_1?s=instant-video&ie=UTF8&qid=1545416303&sr=1-1&keywords=The+Guru+merchant+ivory"},"The Guru"],",” about an English rock star who, like George Harrison, comes to India to study sitar.

Eventually, she becomes jaundiced, literally and figuratively: “Everything I had once liked so much—people, places, crowds, smells—I now feared and hated.” Like many Jhabvala heroines, she ends up longing to escape from India but finds herself incapable of doing so, an addict drugged by experience."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5c1ae11d286bc006c37e8297%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225c1ae11d286bc006c37e8297%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F5c1ae11d286bc006c37e8297%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5c1ae11d286bc006c37e8297"}]],["p","“",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/experience-India-Prawer-Jhabvala-1972-01-01/dp/B01A0C94CC/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1545416353&sr=1-3&keywords=An+Experience+of+India+jhabvala"},"An Experience of India"],"” was the title story of a 1971 collection, which Jhabvala prefaced with an autobiographical essay, “Myself in India.” In it, Jhabvala describes being spun around a wheel of Western reactions to India, writing, “First stage: tremendous enthusiasm—everything Indian is marvelous; second stage, everything Indian not so marvelous; third stage, everything Indian abominable.” She can no longer shake an awareness that “the most salient fact about India is that it is very poor and very backward.” She shuts the blinds, cranks up the air-conditioning, and buries herself in literature in an effort to avoid the deprivation around her, but “all the time I know myself to be on the back of this great animal of poverty and backwardness.”"],["p","The piece presents Jhabvala at her acid best, in a viciously observed sketch of Delhi high society: the Oxbridge-educated hostess is attired in “handloom saris and traditional jewelry,” “trays of iced drinks are carried around by servants in uniform, and there is intelligent conversation, and then there is a superbly arranged buffet supper and more intelligent conversation.” The hostess and her guests “know modern India to be an important subject,” Jhabvala goes on, “but though they themselves ",["em","are"]," modern India, they don’t look at themselves . . . except with the eyes of foreign experts whom they have been taught to respect.” Candid to a fault, “Myself in India” loses its pungency when Jhabvala posits that “most Indians” ignore poverty because of “their belief in reincarnation,” and lapses into tired, if deliberately hyperbolic, characterizations of India as a “bog of passive, intuitive being,” oppressive heat, and fervent paganism. In a later interview, she likened living in India to being in Biblical times, “when there were beggars and lepers.” “Well,” she tutted, “you don’t want to be in Biblical times.” Jane Austen, meet V. S. Naipaul."],["p","Indian critics turned on her. It’s one thing to criticize a society from within; it’s another to do so as a foreigner—and a woman. “If you don’t say that India is simply paradise on earth, and the extended Hindu family the most perfect way of organizing society, you’re anti-Indian,” she told a ",["em","Times"]," interviewer in 1983. “I don’t have many readers there.” Pankaj Mishra has suggested that Jhabvala may have grown so bitter because she lacked “the wide range of experience that V. S. Naipaul and E. M. Forster attested to.” Never mind that she lived in India for decades, unlike either man, and raised three daughters there, and learned to write Hindi. These are essentially the terms Naipaul himself applied to, yes, Jane Austen, whom he disdained as a writer of “sentimental ambitions” with a “narrow view of the world.”"],["p","Aspects of “An Experience of India” recur in Jhabvala’s 1975 novel, “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Heat-Dust-Ruth-Prawer-Jhabvala-ebook/dp/B01D22Z8JK/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1545416483&sr=1-1&keywords=Heat+and+Dust++jhabvala"},"Heat and Dust"],",” which tells the parallel stories of a British woman in India in 1923 and her husband’s granddaughter, who travels to the same town fifty years later.

felt instantly at home in the city. While Europe would forever “smell of blood”—she never returned to Germany—New York was, she said, “the most European place on earth I know.” She rediscovered the Old World of her youth in jars of pickled cucumbers and herring on deli counters; at ballets and concerts; among the furnishings and the accents of her past. She spent the rest of her life based in New York, albeit with a strong tie to India through her beloved husband, whom she called Jhab. Cyrus Jhabvala maintained his architecture practice in Delhi and Ruth spent winters with him there; Cyrus visited New York regularly until he retired and joined her in the United States full time."],["p","Jhabvala spoke little about her particular writing choices, but she often described herself as a chameleon, writing about whatever milieu she inhabited. Henceforth she set her fiction largely in America, often among European migrants. The later stories in “At the End of the Century” introduce readers to “prosperous émigrés from various Central European countries,” who “spoke only in English, though their heavy accents made it sound not unlike their native German”; and wan, wealthy women equally at home in New York, London, or Los Angeles. In some ways, it must have helped Jhabvala’s literary reputation to move to New York at this transitional moment for Indians writing in English. Quite aside from the politics of nationality (when Arundhati Roy won the Booker, in 1997, she was celebrated as the first “true Indian” to do so), Jhabvala’s clipped social satire belongs to a world entirely different from the sprawling canvases and the linguistic innovation of Roy, Rushdie, Amitav Ghosh, and Vikram Seth. Then, too, India had little traction among American readers; even James Ivory confessed that he didn’t read her early ",["em","New Yorker"]," stories, “because at that point I didn’t have much interest in India, and they were Indian stories.” So a shift in setting anchored her in an American literary marketplace."],["p","The focus of her screenwriting changed, too. In the late seventies, Jhabvala proposed an adaptation of Henry James’s “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Europeans-Sketch-Penguin-Classics/dp/0141441402/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1545416672&sr=1-1&keywords=the+europeans+henry+james"},"The Europeans"],"” to Merchant and Ivory, anticipating that the book would be a good match for Ivory’s sensibility. The ensuing series of classic adaptations and historical dramas completed the team’s transformation from makers of lighthearted India-themed films into an Oscar-winning Hollywood brand."],["p","Jhabvala’s fiction does not seem to have benefitted similarly. She published less during her decades in the United States than she had in India, and fewer novels in particular. Judging from their quality, that was perhaps no bad thing. In “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Three-Continents-Ruth-Prawer-Jhabvala-ebook/dp/B01FCLM7NO/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1545416690&sr=1-2&keywords=Three+Continents+jhabvala"},"Three Continents"],"” (1987), a novel about American naïfs caught up in a Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh-style cult, the characters get crushed under a tediously overextended plot. The book seems to have originated in an idea for a screenplay, and its failure as a novel underscores the sense that Jhabvala’s irony and restraint flourished better in compact frames."],["p","Though some of the American stories deliver flashes of the Jhabvala economy—New York captured in snatches of “street smells, petrol fumes, leaking gas pipes, newly poured tar, pretzels, mangoes from Mexico, Chinese noodles, overblown flowers”—her satirical edge, so keen in the Indian fiction, is dulled. Maybe it’s harder to convey ironic detachment when you feel more at home. There’s an evanescence to many of these Western tales, as if Jhabvala’s writing turned its face away from the sun and grew obscure. Two of the central characters in the collection’s title story fade entirely by the time it ends; in the parting scene, they appear only in a photograph, “a shimmer of two figures in light-coloured clothes on the verge of disappearing from sight.”"],["p","It’s in the later stories in this volume that one becomes aware of how much triangulation pervades Jhabvala’s work. It’s not just classic love triangles, though there are many of those—best portrayed in the collection’s final story, “",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/03/25/the-judges-will"},"The Judge’s Will"],",” in which a widow discovers the existence of her husband’s longtime mistress. Jhabvala is an artful geometer, and she skews her angles boldly. Consider “Ménage,” in which a daughter finds out that her mother and aunt share a lover, before sleeping with him herself. Or “Pagans,” in which two sisters sleep with the husband of one, and take up the same young Indian protégé.

obvious analogy is with Jhabvala’s own triangulated life—Europe, India, America—and it prompts the perennial question posed of diasporic, post-colonial, mixed-up, or migrant writers. Where does she fit? The Library of Congress classification system places Jhabvala alongside Indian-origin writers in English, but as a Continental European writing in English she could just as well have been shelved with Joseph Conrad and ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/vladimir-nabokov"},"Vladimir Nabokov"],". It’s equally tricky to situate Jhabvala in the binary of power and powerlessness favored by much post-colonial criticism. As Salman Rushdie once pointed out, “Looked at from the point of view that literature must be nationally connected and even committed, it becomes simply impossible to understand the cast of mind and vision of a rootless intellect like Jhabvala’s.” No intellect can be truly rootless; it always takes hold in the soil of influence and experience. But it’s useless to expect writers to be pine trees, lined up neatly in a forest, when many are more like banyans, whose dangling aerial roots can make them into a forest of one."],["p","The quintessential outsider—“Once you’re a refugee, I guess you’re always a refugee,” Jhabvala said—she sometimes leaves the reader of these stories craving interiority. She is a relentless externalizer, which infuses her plots with a certain energy; but many of her characters do things for reasons they don’t seem to understand themselves, and the reader ends up little wiser. It’s tempting to relate Jhabvala’s emotional reticence to the great silencing of the Holocaust. “You’ve never used any of that as material for your writing, have you?” a radio interviewer asked Jhabvala in 1999. “Effectively, you’ve wiped it out.” “You can’t wipe it out,” she replied, flicking away the inquiry. “You just wish so much it hadn’t happened.” You also imagine there’s a lot to be said."],["p","In screenwriting, though, externalization is everything, and her characteristic restraint was her signal contribution to the other great triangle of her life: Jhabvala, Merchant, Ivory. Actors can supply explanation without words, and, in Jhabvala’s surgically rendered adaptations of Forster, James, and Kazuo Ishiguro, the strangled emotion that plays across the face of an Emma Thompson or an Anthony Hopkins can be exquisitely painful to watch. The distinctive magic of the Merchant Ivory world comes from the juxtaposition of Jhabvala’s verbal austerity and the sumptuous, almost unforgivably stylish scenes laid by Ivory, where every precisely delivered word, wink, or wince finds its material counterpart in the polished salt cellar, the floppy lock, and the sun-saturated Tuscan earth. Jhabvala populated the rooms; Ivory created the view."],["p","One of Ivory’s favorite film sets appears in the 1970 movie “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Bombay-Talkies-Rani-Mukerji/dp/B078851MHV/ref=sr_1_1?s=instant-video&ie=UTF8&qid=1545416815&sr=1-1&keywords=Bombay+Talkie"},"Bombay Talkie"],",” the trio’s fourth film together. “Bombay Talkie” is a meta-narrative about writing and filmmaking, folded around a love triangle involving a British novelist, a movie star, and a screenwriter. In the opening scene, the author gets a tour of a Bombay movie studio. She pauses in front of a giant typewriter, on which dancing girls spring from key to key. “We call it the Fate Machine,” a director tells her sombrely. “Typewriter keys represent the keys of life. And we human beings dance on them. And then when we dance, as we press down the keys of the machine, the story that’s written is the story of our fate.” It’s as clear a statement about the value of writing as the reticent Jhabvala would ever deliver—and, like much of her best work, it’s a satire. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"592e2a57980e951c27678628","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"592e2a57980e951c27678628","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"A Critic at Large","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"a-critic-at-large"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"A Critic at Large","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"a-critic-at-large"}]}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Maya Jasanoff","type":"author","title":"Maya Jasanoff is a professor of history at Harvard.

He greeted a guest with a forearm clasp: “I’m a Quaker, not a shaker.” It didn’t take much to get him going: Happy Rockefeller, Albert Einstein, the Bouvier girls—“I took Jackie out before she met Jack.”"],["p","As Fowler rolled in (a recent health scare had required the temporary use of a wheelchair), Bradley handed him a jumbo shrimp on a paper napkin and said, “Merry Christmas.” Fowler, who was wearing Ugg boots, a safari jacket, and a Citroën ball cap, looked at Bradley and said, “I’m embarrassed to have this affair with a guy dressed like that.”"],["p","Fowler retreated to one end of the room. Guests took turns in the chair beside him. “I’ve gone around the sun eighty-eight times, and I have evolved into thinking a lot about the universe,” he said, to one. “I keep hitting barriers. I have never heard the philosophers talk about the mission of humanity. What the heck is it?”"],["p","“To ravage the earth?”"],["p","“No, I’ve figured it out,” he went on. “It’s to create a quality of life for all the people on the planet. The world of nature is not a very pleasant place. Most living things are fighting and killing and eating each other. I was with some cannibals in Africa years ago, and I asked one of them what his name meant, and he said, ‘It means, I’m strong and my axe is sharp, so no one can kill me or eat me.’ ” Fowler’s wife, Betsey, came by with another shrimp."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5c1d35fd41e4c73c088d6b93%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225c1d35fd41e4c73c088d6b93%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F5c1d35fd41e4c73c088d6b93%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5c1d35fd41e4c73c088d6b93"}]],["p","The Fowlers live in Rowayton, Connecticut, but maintain a wildlife ranch (zebras, elands, and ostriches running free) in Jim’s native town of Albany, Georgia, where his father, an Indiana Quaker and a soil scientist, settled after the First World War to grow pecans."],["p","As incorrigible explorers and networkers, Bradley and Fowler—J.B. and Jungle Jim—had developed a deep kinship over the years, seasoned with competitive spunk. Their families were close. Carrie Fowler had grown up with Bradley’s daughter, Camilla, the founder of the clothing company CK Bradley, who was also present, and, like Carrie, tall, blond, and dressed all in red. A half-dozen children scampered around on the floor."],["p","Fowler, asked how he and Bradley had met, said, “There was a party—do you know Gina Lollobrigida?” The Italian actress. Of course. “She asked me to come to Africa with her to look for an endangered species. I wasn’t married at the time, and . . . ” Carrie began to roll him away. It was time for a speech. The men assembled beneath a screen showing photos of their younger, haler selves. Apparently under siege, a bartender, who’d set up his wares by a pair of giant elephant tusks, fled his post, and a phalanx of guests moved in to serve themselves.

It dates him.”"],["p","Fowler went on: “I’ve had a few close calls. In the Amazon, I made a mistake. I was approaching an eighteen-foot anaconda, and I slipped. It grabbed me by the hand and swallowed my arm up to the shoulder.” Most of the guests had heard this one, but he kept on, in the ingenuous manner that had made him a regular guest of Johnny Carson, who’d dubbed him Jim Foul-Up. “Anaconda have half-inch teeth, so I couldn’t pull it out. Sorry, getting gory.” Bradley jumped in with another anaconda anecdote, in which he rescued Fowler by jabbing the serpent between the eyes with a needle."],["p","Bradley then segued into one of his go-to yarns, about being kidnapped, en route from the Jordanian royal palace to see the Syrian Prime Minister in Damascus. He was strung up with barbed wire from the limb of a fig tree. His interpreter, luckily, was the niece of the leader of the Druze. “He got us released and sent us a fast donkey.”"],["p","Somebody’s grandson, in green pants and a bowl cut, crawled by on the carpet and nearly clipped Bradley in the calves.

tween Irum’s Beauty Spot and Primetime Bakery, below a tall palm, a makeshift stall has appeared. It’s constructed from coarsely woven white plastic sheeting with “Save the Children” and a jumping jack printed on it in red. A boy, perhaps in his late teens, is sitting on an upturned crate in front of it, with a shoe, heel up, in his lap."],["p","“It’s a dying art,” Amer says to him, slamming and then reslamming the door of his battered Civic behind him."],["p","“It’s the glue,” the boy says. He wipes the excess from the welt of the shoe with a grubby, balled-up cloth. “With the right one, you’re set. None of this UHU superglue. The one like paste. Like flour and water.” The midday sun catches his eyelashes and the thick edge of his nose. He presses his fingers against the sole of the shoe and his nails flush white."],["p","The electricity cables overhead are slack and swaying. An electrician is perched in the crook of the tree, where the branches meet the trunk, holding a cable with one hand and balancing himself with the other."],["p","A rickshaw throttles past Amer. A man parks his sugarcane cart in the shade of a flowering jacaranda tree. He switches on the rattling motor of his juicer and sharpens a giant blade against a stone."],["p","Amer’s mother’s voice cuts through the clamor. Above him, he sees her wheelchair reverse from their balcony into the apartment. The sea air has filigreed the railings with rust."],["p","Upstairs, Amer finds her sitting in the dark, the ayah fanning her with a folded newspaper."],["p","“Small mercies,” she says. “What happened today?”"],["p","“They are making offices,” Amer says. “Where our house is.”"],["p","She gives a little shriek, like air squeaking from a balloon."],["p","“At the end of the month,” Amer says. “Let’s not talk about it again. There’s a shoe boy downstairs. Do you have anything for him?”"],["p","“I saw you talking from the balcony,” his mother says. “Dirty-looking.” She smooths the fabric of her housecoat against her lap."],["p","The ayah follows him out of the room and taps him on the elbow. “There was a trunk of your father’s shoes,” she says. “That boy could have sold them.”"],["p","Amer takes an old pair of shoes to be repaired. One has a hole in the sole. “The foot is the noblest part of the body,” the boy says. He slips a hand inside the shoe. “It is the body’s beast of burden. It is the foot soldier for the body’s army. Two hundred rupees at Maghrib.”"],["p","An electricity cable swishes alongside a pole, fuzzy at the end like an elephant’s tail."],["p","Amer returns to the apartment. What was in the plot opposite their block has been demolished. A pit has been dug and girders and pillars stacked. A mosque has appeared on the far corner of the plot with a minaret so tall and narrow it should topple. The shadows of tree branches lengthen across the ceiling of his bedroom. He hears the azaan as though the muezzin were at the foot of his bed."],["p","He goes down to collect the shoes. The boy asks him to sit. He rolls a steel cannister along its fine edge to Amer. Amer tries the shoes on."],["p","The boy watches him wedge his heel in with a finger. “You have wide, flat feet,” he says. “Not graceful but dependable.” He directs Amer to walk, and Amer strides to a Suzuki pickup parked a short distance away and back."],["p","“I have some shoes of my father’s,” Amer says. “Maybe you can sell them.”"],["p","“I don’t sell shoes,” the boy says. “But bring them.”"],["p","Upstairs, his mother and the ayah are arguing over his mother’s handbag. Each holds one side and it gapes between them. “There was,” his mother says. “I know there was.” A bulb in a lamp on a side table flickers and fizzes."],["p","“There wasn’t,” the ayah says. “I bought butter and flour and dal. What did I buy that with?”"],["p","“And you’ve broken every cup,” his mother says, letting go of the bag. She grabs a cup from the table and shakes it at the ayah. “Bring me the set. There are fifty-two pieces. I want to see every one.”"],["p","“We should put something up,” Amer says. There are dark squares on the wall where pictures used to hang. “It doesn’t look nice.”"],["p","“They’re tearing down the old house,” his mother tells the ayah. “Have you heard? That bastard his brother. They allowed us nothing of his. To come and take the pictures. As though we were thieves. And now the house.” She covers her eyes with crooked fingers. Amer thinks of his father, delighted but never happy. He thinks of the chowkidar’s son bursting through the back door of the house, shouting, “He’s fallen! He’s fallen like a bird in the street.”"],["p","From the balcony, Amer can see the boy packing up his stall. He unpins the sheeting from four metal rods, which are splayed against uneven paving stones, and folds it into a suitcase, along with several plastic bags of shoes. He ducks into the doorway of their building with the crate he sits on and then again with the steel cannister he offered to Amer. With the case balanced on his shoulder, the boy walks down the darkening street in the direction of Clifton. Amer imagines him tending goats on a green hillside."],["p","“We offered to send him to the best schools,” his mother tells the ayah, nodding toward Amer. “Oxford, Cambridge. People were begging their parents to go, but he wouldn’t. He wanted to stay. We were happy, of course. But now he could be making millions.” She fishes a dirty hundred-rupee note out of a pocket of her handbag and gives it triumphantly to the ayah."],["p","Amer finds a pair of alligator Gucci loafers that were his father’s at the back of his mother’s cupboard, with an empty bottle of Monsieur de Givenchy slotted inside one and a razor with a bone handle in the other. He takes the shoes to the boy in the morning. Someone has tied the loose electricity cable to the pole with a thick red cloth."],["p","“Good quality,” the boy says.

A crowd is milling purposefully outside Kolachi, and cars are triple-parked. Amer chooses somewhere farther along the row, almost at the end. They climb up steps that are slabs of stone and emerge onto a small gravel patch with a thatched roof on bamboo pillars. A neon light between the pillars buzzes. There are white plastic chairs and small round tables and in the corner a broad chest freezer. They choose a couple of chairs where the patch ends at a steep rockface and the sea."],["p","The boy orders an ice-cream soda and Amer orders another. Lights are pinned to the rocks below, and the sea is lit in shafts of lurid green that sparkle with moths and drifting plastic bags. They watch for fish. A wooden boat bobs past.

He did things for other people all the time. There were people in a line at the door every morning with things for him to do. It wasn’t his fault. He was always somewhere else. But also just here.” The boy shifts in his seat. “With a man like that, such a man, there’s no point in trying to be him. Just to learn.”"],["p","“My mother did things,” the boy says. “She took the ox out to the field and gathered alfalfa and sowed seed. She put mud on the walls and dung in the fire. She planted trees.

People throng outside McDonald’s and the Cineplex, and cars queue to park in the shopping mall. Amer slows the car outside a high wall on a quiet, broad street lit dimly by wrought-iron lamps. A name and telephone number are painted on the wall. “I know it isn’t here,” he says. “I know it. So why do I feel like it is?” He looks hard at the boy and stops the car. He gets out, and he and the boy stand facing the wall. He puts his hands on it. “What is it? Nothing. But I can’t be here. I can’t look at it.”"],["p","“It was your house?” the boy asks."],["p","Amer nods."],["p","“Quite a big house,” the boy says."],["p","“And inside—you can’t see from here—there are trees and trees, pepper trees, almond trees, and then the house. An old house. The stationmaster’s from British times.” Here and there, bricks jut out at angles from the wall. Amer steps up on one and then another until his chin reaches the top. “See,” he says. There are lights in the garden, and the house pulses golden at the center of a small forest of trees. It has a shingled roof and a columned portico. “This was a lawn,” he says. “The best in Karachi. Dhaka grass.” The boy glances over his shoulder, then kicks off his sandals and clambers up to the top of the wall, then slips softly over."],["p","“There’s a chowkidar,” Amer says. He hops down. He hears scrabbling from the other side."],["p","“I can’t come back,” the boy says. “There’s nothing to hold.”"],["p","“There must be something,” Amer says. He climbs up again, losing his shoes, which clatter to the pavement. He swivels onto the top of the wall and reaches over to the boy. The tips of their fingers touch. Then he finds himself tumbling over the wall and onto the lush grass on the other side. He looks around to orient himself. The driveway is overgrown and strewn with split black jamuns. The light of a TV flickers from the chowkidar’s hut by the gate. The hut has an opening and a pair of crossed feet are propped in it."],["p","“We put tables here for parties,” Amer says, and pulls the boy along the upward-sloping lawn. “And a bandstand in the corner and lights in the trees.” They reach the portico. “These steps are worn”—he rubs his foot along one—“from people running in and out.” The front door is padlocked and a peeling notice is taped to it. “If there is anything inside,” Amer says, “we’ll take it.” He tries a window and then another and then a third, which rattles open, and they duck through."],["p","A thick layer of soft dust covers the floor. The back wall of the house is a heap of bricks and rubble on the ground and the moon hangs in a corner like a lantern, casting a silvery-pink sheen over everything. Weeds and hedges and slender tree trunks frame the edges of the house. A digger is poised at a distance with its shovel suspended."],["p","The first floor has crumbled away to the walls. The staircase ends a few steps up and then begins again, hanging from the ceiling by its bannisters. Amer’s knees shake and he thinks he will fall."],["p","The boy puts his hand on Amer’s shoulder. “Friend,” he says, “it was a big house.”"],["p","Birds rustle and flap in the rafters. “It was,” Amer says. He turns his palms up. He looks at them and they are broad like his father’s."],["p","He takes a step forward. “This”—he reaches to the left—“was a guest suite and here”—he indicates the right—“was my father’s study. The handle only worked from the inside. I don’t know why. And there was a table”—he spreads his arms wide—“with pictures of my father with people. He had a sofa here.” He turns. “And here was a hall, with the drawing room on this side. The windows opened onto the garden. Here the dining room.” The boy watches him. “There was a swinging door to the kitchen and then you came around again to the pantry, where my mother made toast and tea and packet soup. This was a courtyard. These pillars went all the way around. You can see that the ground is lower here. There was a fountain. And the stairs went up to my father’s bedroom.” He points above him. “My mother’s was here and mine between the two.” He walks the perimeter of the building, trailing his hand along the boundary wall."],["p","He remembers music playing from the lawn, hearing it as he lay in bed upstairs, and laughter and glasses clinking and someone shouting for ice, plenty of ice."],["p","“We had peacocks,” he says, returning to the boy. “People say they’re bad luck. They make a terrible noise.” Silvery light is in the boy’s hair, along the inside of his collar, on the tips of his fingers. Footsteps glow in the thick dust. Footsteps facing forward and backward, turning in concentric circles around them, as though they were a crowd of people. Amer steps nearer. A mynah calls from the garden and another answers. He steps closer again until his toes are over the boy’s toes. He leans in toward the boy’s lips. Their eyelashes brush. The boy slips his arm between them and pushes Amer. “Uncle,” he says."],["p","“The foot says stay,” Amer says, and bears his weight down."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3E%E2%80%9CI%E2%80%99m%20not%20well%2C%E2%80%9D%20his%20mother%20tells%20him%20in%20the%20morning%2C%20and%20her%20teacup%20trembles%20in%20her%20hand.%20The%20fan%20whips%20around.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3E%E2%80%9CThe%20power%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20says.%20%E2%80%9CThey%20fixed%20the%20cables.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3E%E2%80%9CI%E2%80%99m%20full%20of%20rage%2C%E2%80%9D%20his%20mother%20says.%20%E2%80%9CI%20don%E2%80%99t%20know%20why.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3E%E2%80%9CI%20went%20to%20the%20house.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3E%E2%80%9CWhat%20happened%20to%20it%3F%E2%80%9D%20she%20says.%20Then%20she%20looks%20around.%20%E2%80%9CWhy%20are%20we%20here%3F%20Whose%20apartment%20is%20this%3F%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EHe%20waits%20but%20her%20expression%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20change.%20%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s%20ours%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20says.%20%E2%80%9CYou%20know.%20This%20is%20all%20you%20talk%20about.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EShe%20shakes%20her%20head.%20%E2%80%9CI%20don%E2%80%99t.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3E%E2%80%9CAfter%20Daddy%2C%20they%20said%20the%20house%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20ours.%20That%20he%E2%80%99d%20given%20it%20to%20Chacha.%20We%20filed%20the%20cases.%20You%20had%20to%20sign%20the%20papers.%20Every%20page%E2%80%94one%20after%20the%20other.%20What%20have%20I%20done%20these%20seven%20years%20but%20come%20and%20go%20from%20there%3F%20Hearing%2C%20hearing%2C%20hearing%2C%20but%20no%20one%20to%20listen.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3E%E2%80%9CYes%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20says%20slowly.%20%E2%80%9CWeren%E2%80%99t%20we%20happy%20there.%20Take%20me%20out%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20tells%20the%20ayah%2C%20replacing%20her%20cup%20on%20its%20saucer.%20The%20ayah%20wheels%20her%20to%20the%20doors%20that%20open%20onto%20the%20balcony%20and%20over%20the%20threshold.%20%E2%80%9CThey%20say%20the%20city%E2%80%99s%20changed.%20I%20haven%E2%80%99t%20seen%20it.%20Your%20father%20and%20I%20ran%20away%20from%20that%20house.%20I%20couldn%E2%80%99t%20have%20been%20a%20day%20over%20fifteen.%20There%20was%20a%20little%20gate%20at%20the%20back%20and%20he%20met%20me%20there%20one%20night%20in%20his%20car%20with%20the%20engine%20running.%20It%20was%20so%20dark%20I%20thought%20it%20was%20empty.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3E%E2%80%9CYou%E2%80%99re%20thinking%20of%20somewhere%20else%2C%E2%80%9D%20Amer%20says%2C%20following%20her%20onto%20the%20balcony%2C%20resting%20his%20hand%20lightly%20on%20her%20shoulder.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EBelow%2C%20there%20is%20no%20sign%20of%20the%20stall.%20A%20digger%20has%20returned%20to%20the%20plot%20opposite%20their%20apartment.%20Its%20shovel%20rings%20against%20the%20stony%20earth.%C2%A0%E2%99%A6%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","“I’m not well,” his mother tells him in the morning, and her teacup trembles in her hand.

the warm kitchen of a bungalow just off a two-lane road in far-western Ireland, the novelist Sally Rooney, her mother, her sister, and her mother’s friend were contesting the issues of the day over a supper of pork loin, roasted potatoes, green beans, red peppers, and applesauce. The pace of the conversation was brisk, the threshold for entry high. You had to be careful with the prosecco."],["p","“A Star Is Born” came up. The film’s lone advocate was quickly crushed with an analysis of its gender politics and time-line issues. The discussion turned to Brexit. We were in Castlebar, County Mayo, at the home of Rooney’s mother, Marie Farrell. Everyone was worried about what would happen to the Irish border if the United Kingdom left the European Union without an agreement in place. And what of the Labour Party? Rooney said that although she didn’t exactly love the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, she did want him to become Prime Minister."],["p","I asked what she made of Corbyn’s lukewarm support for Europe in the run-up to the Brexit vote."],["p","“I was Remain, like any sensible person,” she answered."],["p","In “",["a",{"href":"https://thedublinreview.com/article/even-if-you-beat-me/"},"Even if You Beat Me"],",” the 2015 essay that launched her career, Rooney looked back on her time as the “number one competitive debater on the continent of Europe.” The essay is excellent, but Rooney now sort of wishes she hadn’t written it, seeing it as an inadvertent overshare. “I wrote it with a confident sense of my own anonymity,” she told me. An agent, Tracy Bohan, of the Wylie Agency, saw the piece and got in touch with Rooney. “I said, I know you write fiction as well. Do you have any material you’d like to share?” Bohan recalled. Rooney gave her a manuscript, which, a month later, Bohan sent to publishers. She received bids from seven of them."],["p","Rooney’s fiction is largely concerned with the power dynamics of social groups. Maybe it’s unfair, then, to begin an article about her by citing a stray piece of personal nonfiction. But her acknowledgment, in the essay, of a “taste for ritualized, abstract interpersonal aggression” provides a better insight into her habits of mind than any I could manufacture. I can make a strong case for beginning with it. At the same time, I can imagine Rooney—who recalls having “nursed intense romantic obsessions for droll counterfactuals”—noting the unoriginality of invoking her collegiate debating record as evidence of her verbal precocity. She gets in your head like that."],["p","Thomas Morris, a writer in Dublin, told me that his friendship with Rooney began at a university literary-society event, over a platter of Bakewell tarts. Morris said to Rooney that he’d rate the tarts an eight on a scale from one to ten. She was sure that they deserved a six. Then they started sparring over whether they were ranking the Bakewell tarts as Bakewell tarts or as food in general. “I naïvely, arrogantly thought because I was older that I would win the argument,” Morris said, at one of Rooney’s recent book events. “But you can guess how it went: Sally was right, and I was wrong. And I knew immediately that I wanted to be friends with this person who could so easily upend, and transform, my view of the world—and my ranking system for cakes.”"],["p","A lifelong Marxist, Rooney is particularly outspoken about issues that stir her social conscience. Shortly before the publication of “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Conversations-Friends-Novel-Sally-Rooney/dp/0451499050"},"Conversations with Friends"],",” her first novel, in 2017, a piece about her appeared in the ",["em","Irish Independent"],".

But how has he become this sort of emblem of literary Irishness when he was this horrible man? He was a huge fan of Mussolini, he was really into fascism, he believed deeply in the idea of a ‘noble class’ who are superior by birth to the plebs. And he was in the Senate."],["p","“He wasn’t just this harmless weirdo who wrote poetry. People misinterpret him in this country, and when we’re taught about him in school, it’s just hagiography.”"]],["p","Rooney’s voice is bright and crisp. There’s something autumnal about her. It’s hard to see how you could characterize her as shrieky, unless you believe that forthright and vigorous speech from women in their twenties necessarily constitutes shrieking. But her criticism of a national hero—and her assumption of the standing to do so—caused a small controversy. “Oh, my God, that was so ill-advised, trashing Yeats!” she told me, seeming more amused than chagrined. The piece made no mention of a scene in the book in which Frances, the narrator and one of a quartet of entangled friends, tells Nick, with whom she’s having an affair, that she recently slept with a guy she met on Tinder. Nick, chopping onions, asks what he was like. “He was awful,” Frances answers."],["blockquote",["p","He told me he loved Yeats, can you believe that?

The book blew away many people, including Zadie Smith, who praised it as one of those “debuts where you just can’t believe that it was a debut,” and Sarah Jessica Parker, who wrote, on Instagram, “This book. This book. I read it in one day. I hear I’m not alone.” The marketing tagline, “Salinger for the Snapchat generation,” was apt in its evocation of freshness, but Rooney is too cool, in both senses of the word, for the description to fully work. Her characters are let down by the adult world, but intrigued, too, and maybe galvanized. Their default attitude is a raised eyebrow. They fear that they might be the biggest phonies of all. The book even looks cool: its bright-yellow cover features an Alex Katz painting of two stone-faced young women, one with red lips and the other in dark glasses."],["p","Rooney’s second novel, “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Normal-People-Novel-Sally-Rooney/dp/1984822179/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_img_2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=AA958WXJ8XSNN3YV3G8J"},"Normal People"],",” was nominated for the 2018 Man Booker Prize, and will be released in the United States in April. According to ",["em","The Bookseller"],", it was the year’s most critically praised book in the United Kingdom. Like “Conversations with Friends,” it is basically a romantic tragicomedy. The point is not so much the plot as the characters, and the heady relationships in and out of which they move “like figure-skaters, improvising their discussions so adeptly and in such perfect synchronization that it surprises them.” In the opening chapters, Marianne, a smart and unpopular high-school student whose single mother is a lawyer, begins a secret relationship with Connell, a smart and popular high-school student whose single mother cleans Marianne’s family’s house. “She just acted the same as always, like it never happened, reading her book at the lockers as usual, getting into pointless arguments,” Rooney writes. One of the unusual pleasures of Rooney’s novels is watching young women engage in a casual intellectual hooliganism, demolishing every mediocrity that crosses their paths, just for the fun of it."],["p","The quality of thought eliminates the need for pen-twirling rhetorical flourishes. Rooney’s most devastating lines are often her most affectless. In “Conversations with Friends,” a party at Melissa and Nick’s is “full of music and people wearing long necklaces.” Read that sentence and you may never want to wear jewelry again. In “Normal People,” Connell abandons Marianne, fearing the judgment of his peers if they find out about the relationship. He quickly moves on to the queen bee of the class, less out of enthusiasm than out of a passive acceptance of his social predestiny. “He and Rachel started seeing each other in July,” Rooney writes, in the close third person. “Everyone in school had known she liked him, and she seemed to view the attachment between them as a personal achievement on her part.” A mean girl is no match for an incandescently intelligent one."],["p","Rooney pulls and twists sentences as though they were pieces of balloon art. Words are her superpower, but she is suspicious of them. In “Even if You Beat Me,” she writes about having to extemporize on “the secession of Republika Srpska from Bosnia and Herzegovina” in front of a group of Serbian debaters, and being unsettled by “the composed self-assurance with which we fabricated the history of their region.” She eventually quit debating, finding it “vaguely immoral.” She’s not much more convinced about the social value of the novelist. “There is a part of me that will never be happy knowing that I am just writing entertainment, making decorative aesthetic objects at a time of historical crisis,” she told the ",["em","Irish Independent"],"."],["p","The day after the supper in Castlebar, Rooney and I took the train to Dublin, where she lives. We sat facing each other across a table. The night before, she had mused aloud about her attitude toward interviews. “There are two warring aspects of my personality,” she said. “One of which is a desire to be friendly and nice, because I know journalists don’t love you to give monosyllabic responses. The second is: don’t tell them anything.” Now she had a question for me. She asked it politely but seriously. Why did I think that a profile of her was worth writing? If this were a debate, the motion might have been: This house, while honored, fundamentally believes that we are wasting our time."],["p","I said that I thought her books meant a lot to readers, who would understand them better by hearing what she had to say. I brought up something that she had written on Twitter, before she temporarily shut down her account: “novelists are given too much cultural prominence. I know you could point out they’re really not given a lot of prominence but . . . it’s still too much.” I didn’t necessarily agree, I said. I rambled a little."],["p","Rooney leaves you with a lot to think about. Your ",["em","esprit de l’escalier"]," doesn’t kick in until you’re well out the door. When she was a teen-ager, she joined a writing group at a local arts center. One of its organizers, Ken Armstrong, said that, even then, there was “a thread of steel running through her.” I wanted to know where Rooney got her mettle, how a Marxist ended up writing a book that sits alongside body lotion and silk pajamas in ",["em","GQ’s"]," “30 Fail-Safe Gifts for Her” guide; how she upended the conventional wisdom that a writer should show and not tell, that characters shouldn’t say what they think, in the process creating some of the best dialogue I’ve read. There is a quiet but insistent sense of challenge in her writing. It makes you wonder whether you’re wearing the moral equivalent of a long

are living in a great epistolary age, even if no one much acknowledges it. Our phones, by obviating phoning, have reëstablished the omnipresence of text. Think of the sheer profusion of messages, of all the things we once said—or didn’t say—that we now send. “You don’t have any news you’ve been waiting to tell me in person, do you?” Nathan, a software developer, asks Sukie, his much younger roommate, upon picking her up at the airport, in “",["a",{"href":"https://granta.com/mr-salary/"},"Mr Salary"],",” a short story that Rooney published, in 2016, in ",["em","Granta"],". “Do people do that?” she says. “You don’t have like a secret tattoo or anything?” he continues. “I would have attached it as a JPEG,” she replies. “Believe me.” Rooney told me, “A lot of critics have noticed that my books are basically nineteenth-century novels dressed up in contemporary clothing.”"],["p","The Internet isn’t Rooney’s subject, any more than the letter was Austen’s, but she has assimilated online communication into a new kind of prose. “She does it in a way that’s totally natural,” Bohan, her agent, told me. “Whereas, if it were someone in his or her forties or fifties, it’d sort of be, like, ‘I Am Writing a Novel About the Internet.’ ” Rooney told me that in “Conversations with Friends” she was interested in exploring “e-mail voice,” the way that Frances and her friends “curate their styles of communication online.” This isn’t a flashy conceptual move; it’s just that e-mails, texts, instant messages, and Facebook posts are an unquestioned part of her characters’ everyday routines. A novel without them would be like a novel without chairs. After an illicit kiss, Frances receives an e-mail from Nick, and forces herself to wait an hour before responding. “I watched some cartoons on the Internet and made a cup of coffee,” she recalls. “Then I read his e-mail again several times. I was relieved he had put the whole thing in lower case like he always did. It would have been dramatic to introduce capitalization at such a moment of tension.” Reading our lives, we are all New Critics."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5c1d5caa8c22f948fa9ba873%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225c1d5caa8c22f948fa9ba873%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F5c1d5caa8c22f948fa9ba873%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5c1d5caa8c22f948fa9ba873"}]],["p","Later, Frances and Bobbi try to watch the movie “Brazil,” but Bobbi falls asleep. “I didn’t feel like watching the film on my own,” Frances says, “so I switched it off and just read the Internet instead.” An older novelist might have written “surfed the Internet” or “looked at the Internet,” but “read the Internet” has the ring of native digital literacy. There’s also something current about the flatness of Rooney’s tone; like “breaking the Internet,” “reading the Internet” makes a little joke of the juxtaposition of a puny active verb and the vastness of the thing upon which it is acting. Rooney’s transposition of Internet voice to the page brings a certain tension to her narration. When Frances observes that “Melissa used a big professional camera and kept lots of different lenses in a special camera pouch,” it’s impossible to tell whether she’s impressed by Melissa or mocking her. As with a tweet, you might interpret the sentence either way."],["p","Perhaps refreshingly, for an Irish writer, Rooney has been received as a voice more of her time than of her place. The ",["em","Times"]," called her “the first great millennial author.” She was born in Castlebar in 1991. Marie Farrell, her mother, taught math and science and spent two years volunteering in Lesotho in the eighties. Eventually, she became the director of the Linenhall, a community arts center in Castlebar. (“A lady with no airs but an abundance of graces Marie Farrell eschews the stereotype arty image betimes associated with the discipline,” a tribute in the local newspaper read.) Kieran Rooney, Sally’s father, worked as a technician for Ireland’s state-owned telecom company. (It was privatized in 1999.) He and Farrell took Sally and her two siblings to church, but they were more passionate about passing on socialist values. Marx’s dictum “From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs” was the household catechism. During the financial crisis, which ravaged Ireland’s economy, Kieran took an early-retirement package."],["p","Farrell recalls Rooney as a quickly frustrated child who wouldn’t countenance anything that didn’t interest her. (Rooney says that the trait endures, and claims “excessive laziness at anything I’m not good at.”) High school, at St. Joseph’s Secondary School, an all-girls institution where Rooney had to wear a “blue sweater, gingham shirt, and lumpy gray pinafore, which I loathed,” was a particular trial. “I just found it kind of baffling, the whole institution of school,” Rooney said. “I was, like, Does no one see that this is repressive, and that there are more of us than there are of them?” She boycotted homework. “My parents were very much, like, Fight your own battles,” she recalled. She spent hours online, “more comfortable with text than with actual personal interactions.” She said, “I was someone who, in a very disorganized way, was thirsty for knowledge. I liked having access to anything I wanted to know. I still find myself using that aspect of the Internet a lot. I usually have ten open tabs on my phone browser, and they’ll all be, like, ‘What is the boiling point of gold?’ Or ‘frogfish chameleons.’ I saw a frogfish on a nature documentary, and I wanted to know if they are genetically related to chameleons, because they have similar facial characteristics. I don’t think I found anything conclusive.”"],["p","Rooney began writing stories as a teen-ager. She says that they were terrible (“possibly my understanding of human beings was just not that sophisticated”), but she was already drawn to certain scenarios. “Couples, triads,” she said. “If you took something I wrote when I was fifteen, it would be the same, plot-wise, as now.” At eighteen, she published two poems in ",["em","The Stinging Fly"],", a Dublin literary journal, which she now edits.

She hoped to do a double major in sociology and English, but was accepted only into the latter program. She found herself in proximity to a social milieu that she hadn’t known existed: the classmates in “waxed hunting jackets and plum-coloured chinos,” as she writes in “Normal People,” whose parents had “not figuratively” caused the financial crisis that claimed her father’s job. “What I wasn’t prepared for was encountering the class of people who run the country,” she told me. “I had a feeling, on one hand, of being appalled, but on the other hand a real sense of wanting to prove myself to people, to prove I’m just as good as they are. I don’t know why—it would have made a lot more sense to just let them be—but it’s a fascination that’s not purely revulsion.”"],["p","In her third year at Trinity, Rooney fell in love with John Prasifka, who is now a high-school math teacher, and with whom she lives. “I didn’t write any good fiction until I met my partner,” she told me. She won a scholarship that gave her four years of tuition and room and board, and also ratified her sense of belonging. She spent a lot of time eating soup and writing: a master’s thesis on “Captain America” and post-9/11 politics, as well as various permutations of the story that would become “Conversations with Friends.” Like her “culchie” characters—milk-drinking provincials, in Dublin vocabulary—she was aware that her class status was in transition, that her intellectual and sexual capital was intersecting with real money in ways that were hard to make sense of."],["p","“Almost no paths seem definitively closed to her, not even the path of marrying an oligarch,” Rooney writes, of Marianne. “When she goes out at night, men shout the most outrageously vulgar things at her on the street, so obviously they’re not ashamed to desire her, quite the contrary. And in college she often feels there’s no limit to what her brain can do, it can synthesise everything she puts into it, it’s like having a powerful machine inside her head. Really she has everything going for her. She has no idea what she’s going to do with her life.” Rooney has been compared to the novelist ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/08/07/rachel-cusk-gut-renovates-the-novel"},"Rachel Cusk"]," because of her cerebral first-person narration. She says that she admires Cusk, and was surprised that people read her recent review of Cusk’s “Faye” trilogy—“Sometimes I had the sense that the chatty characters who populate these novels were just gamely trying to amuse our austere narrator, who was guaranteed to miss the joke every time”—as critical-in-a-bad-way. She loves Sheila Heti and Ben Lerner. Her writing can occasionally bring to mind Michel Houellebecq’s in its deadpan deflation of consumer society and our helplessness in the face of its predations. Frances, never having “fantasized about a radiant future where I was paid to perform an economic role,” has decided that it’s ethically indefensible to make more than sixteen thousand one hundred dollars a year—the amount that you would get, according to her Wikipedia reading, if you divided the annual gross world product by the number of people on earth."],["p","In the hierarchy of Rooney’s literary identities, millennial is greater than Irish, but post-recessionary may be greater than millennial. Her writing emanates anxiety about capitalism, which purports to be a meritocratic system but actually functions as a diabolical inversion of communism, redistributing wealth and privilege at the whim of the people who already have those things, “for whom surprise birthday parties are thrown and cushy jobs are procured out of nowhere.” If Rooney’s characters aren’t especially ambitious, if they have low stress thresholds, if they prefer foreign vacations to office jobs, forgive them. The game was over by the time they came of age. Rooney is writing novels of manners about an era in which the expectation of caring for others no longer obtains, in which it’s easier to wreck a home than to own one. “I’m trying to show the reality of a social condition as it is connected to broader systems,” she said. “You would hope that by trying to show those things in process you can say, It doesn’t have to be this way.”"]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EToward%20the%20middle%20of%20%E2%80%9CConversations%20with%20Friends%2C%E2%80%9D%20Frances%20goes%20to%20see%20a%20doctor.%20She%20has%20been%20suffering%20for%20some%20time%20from%20an%20unexplained%20malady%20that%20leaves%20her%20underwear%20soaked%20with%20blood%20and%20%E2%80%9Cthick%20gray%20clots%20of%20what%20looked%20like%20skin%20tissue.%E2%80%9D%20Even%20Frances%E2%80%99s%20pain%20seems%20like%20a%20class%20privilege.%20Her%20mother%20is%20solid%E2%80%94her%20%E2%80%9Cbig%20warm%20plane%E2%80%9D%20of%20a%20hand%20is%20%E2%80%9Clike%20something%20that%20could%20grow%20from%20the%20earth.%E2%80%9D%20The%20doctor%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20look%20much%20older%20than%20Frances%20is.%20%E2%80%9CHe%20seemed%20to%20need%20a%20lot%20of%20blood%2C%E2%80%9D%20Frances%20notes%2C%20%E2%80%9Cand%20a%20urine%20sample%20also%2C%20and%20he%20asked%20questions%20about%20my%20sexual%20history.%E2%80%9D%20A%20while%20back%2C%20there%20had%20been%20a%20condom%20mishap%20with%20Nick.%20When%20the%20doctor%20asks%20Frances%20if%20she%E2%80%99s%20ever%20had%20unprotected%20sex%2C%20she%20says%20no%2C%20and%20then%20corrects%20herself%3A%20%E2%80%9CWell%2C%20not%20fully.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cblockquote%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3ENot%20fully%20unprotected%3F%20he%20said.%20I%20don%E2%80%99t%20follow%20you.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EI%20could%20feel%20my%20face%20get%20hot%2C%20but%20I%20replied%20in%20as%20dry%20and%20unconcerned%20a%20voice%20as%20possible.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3ENo%2C%20I%20mean%2C%20not%20full%20sex%2C%20I%20said.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3ERight.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EThen%20I%20looked%20at%20him%20and%20said%3A%20I%20mean%20he%20didn%E2%80%99t%20come%20inside%20me%2C%20am%20I%20not%20being%20clear%3F%20He%20looked%20back%20down%20at%20his%20clipboard%20then.%20We%20hated%20each%20other%20energetically%2C%20I%20could%20see%20that.%20Before%20he%20went%20away%2C%20he%20said%20they%20would%20test%20the%20urine%20for%20pregnancy.%20Typically%20the%20hCG%20levels%20would%20remain%20elevated%20for%20up%20to%20ten%20days%2C%20that%E2%80%99s%20what%20he%20said%20before%20he%20left.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3C%2Fblockquote%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3ERooney%20writes%20exquisitely%20about%20bodies.%20Her%20depiction%20of%20Frances%20and%20Nick%E2%80%99s%20sex%20is%20so%20intense%20(%E2%80%9CThe%20inside%20of%20my%20body%20was%20hot%20like%20oil%E2%80%9D)%2C%20so%20tender%20(%E2%80%9CI%20had%20been%20so%20terribly%20noisy%20and%20theatrical%20all%20the%20way%20through%20that%20it%20was%20impossible%20now%20to%20act%20indifferent%20like%20I%20did%20in%20e-mails%E2%80%9D)%2C%20that%20the%20reader%20feels%20viscerally%20the%20doctor%E2%80%99s%20trespass%2C%20his%20spoliation%20of%20their%20private%20world.%20Sex%20is%20the%20I.R.L.-est%20thing%20there%20is.%20It%20provides%20a%20respite%20from%20a%20surveilling%20society%2C%20even%20as%20it%20exposes%20you%20to%20a%20single%20other%20soul.%20Given%20the%20novel%E2%80%99s%20sensuality%2C%20it%20feels%20odd%20that%20we%20learn%20nothing%20about%20the%20physical%20dimension%20of%20Frances%20and%20Bobbi%E2%80%99s%20relationship.%20When%20I%20asked%20Rooney%20why%20that%20is%2C%20she%20said%2C%20%E2%80%9CFrances%2C%20in%20her%20narrative%2C%20is%20exercising%20a%20sort%20of%20mastery%20over%20the%20people%20she%20writes%20about.%20She%20has%20so%20much%20respect%20and%20adulation%20for%20Bobbi%20that%20it%20felt%20like%20she%20wouldn%E2%80%99t%20have%20done%20that%20to%20Bobbi%2C%20in%20some%20way.%E2%80%9D%20Rooney%E2%80%99s%20depiction%20of%20the%20doctor%20is%20made%20especially%20pointed%20by%20the%20fact%20that%20he%20is%20Frances%E2%80%99s%20peer.%20The%20patriarchy%20has%20rarely%20seemed%20more%20banal%20and%20inescapable.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EFrances%2C%20thinking%20she%E2%80%99s%20miscarrying%2C%20tells%20herself%2C%20%E2%80%9CThe%20pregnancy%20was%20already%20over%2C%20and%20I%20didn%E2%80%99t%20need%20to%20consider%20things%20like%20Irish%20constitutional%20law%2C%20the%20right%20to%20travel%2C%20my%20current%20bank%20balance%2C%20and%20so%20on.%E2%80%9D%20When%20%E2%80%9CConversations%20with%20Friends%E2%80%9D%20was%20published%2C%20abortion%20was%20illegal%20in%20Ireland.%20Last%20spring%2C%20the%20country%20held%20a%20referendum%20on%20whether%20to%20repeal%20the%20Eighth%20Amendment%2C%20which%20forbade%20abortion%20in%20all%20but%20the%20most%20extreme%20circumstances.%20Rooney%20went%20all%20out%20for%20the%20Yes%20cause.%20On%20Twitter%2C%20she%20was%20uncharacteristically%20undone%20(%E2%80%9Cif%20you%20haven%E2%80%99t%20already%20voted%20yes%2C%20do%20it%20now!!!!!%20now!!!%20we%20have%20just%20over%20an%20hour%20to%20go%2C%20please%20please%20don%E2%80%99t%20miss%20this%20chance%E2%80%9D).%20In%20an%20%3Ca%20href%3D%5C%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lrb.co.uk%2Fv40%2Fn10%2Fsally-rooney%2Fan-irish-problem%5C%22%3Eessay%3C%2Fa%3E%20for%20the%20%3Cem%3ELondon%20Review%20of%20Books%3C%2Fem%3E%2C%20she%20unleashed%20he

the middle of “Conversations with Friends,” Frances goes to see a doctor. She has been suffering for some time from an unexplained malady that leaves her underwear soaked with blood and “thick gray clots of what looked like skin tissue.” Even Frances’s pain seems like a class privilege. Her mother is solid—her “big warm plane” of a hand is “like something that could grow from the earth.” The doctor doesn’t look much older than Frances is. “He seemed to need a lot of blood,” Frances notes, “and a urine sample also, and he asked questions about my sexual history.” A while back, there had been a condom mishap with Nick. When the doctor asks Frances if she’s ever had unprotected sex, she says no, and then corrects herself: “Well, not fully.”"],["blockquote",["p","Not fully unprotected? he said.

Her depiction of Frances and Nick’s sex is so intense (“The inside of my body was hot like oil”), so tender (“I had been so terribly noisy and theatrical all the way through that it was impossible now to act indifferent like I did in e-mails”), that the reader feels viscerally the doctor’s trespass, his spoliation of their private world. Sex is the I.R.L.-est thing there is. It provides a respite from a surveilling society, even as it exposes you to a single other soul. Given the novel’s sensuality, it feels odd that we learn nothing about the physical dimension of Frances and Bobbi’s relationship. When I asked Rooney why that is, she said, “Frances, in her narrative, is exercising a sort of mastery over the people she writes about. She has so much respect and adulation for Bobbi that it felt like she wouldn’t have done that to Bobbi, in some way.” Rooney’s depiction of the doctor is made especially pointed by the fact that he is Frances’s peer. The patriarchy has rarely seemed more banal and inescapable."],["p","Frances, thinking she’s miscarrying, tells herself, “The pregnancy was already over, and I didn’t need to consider things like Irish constitutional law, the right to travel, my current bank balance, and so on.” When “Conversations with Friends” was published, abortion was illegal in Ireland. Last spring, the country held a referendum on whether to repeal the Eighth Amendment, which forbade abortion in all but the most extreme circumstances. Rooney went all out for the Yes cause. On Twitter, she was uncharacteristically undone (“if you haven’t already voted yes, do it now!!!!! now!!! we have just over an hour to go, please please don’t miss this chance”). In an ",["a",{"href":"https://www.lrb.co.uk/v40/n10/sally-rooney/an-irish-problem"},"essay"]," for the ",["em","London Review of Books"],", she unleashed her rhetorical gifts. “I was born in 1991, the same year a Virgin Megastore in Dublin was raided for selling condoms without a pharmacist present,” she wrote. “Two years before the decriminalisation of homosexuality. Four years before the legalisation of divorce. Twenty-seven years, I can only hope, before the repeal of the Eighth Amendment.” She told me, “When the referendum passed, I felt like the official institutions of the state were catching up to the country I had grown up in.”"],["p","Frances turns out to have endometriosis, but she feels strangely distraught over the baby that she didn’t want and that never existed. Her physical condition worsens. In one of the book’s most surprising moments, she seeks solace in reading the Gospels. One day, she finds herself staggering into a church. Frances has a wry approach to Christianity (“Jesus didn’t talk very much during Mark’s gospel, which made me more interested in reading the others”), but she seems to take it seriously. Sitting in a pew, filling her lungs with incense, for the first time since she was a child, she feels that she is connecting with something profound. “Am I myself or am I them?” she asks. “Is this me, Frances? No, it is not me. It is the others. Do I sometimes hurt and harm myself, do I abuse the unearned cultural privilege of whiteness, do I take the labor of others for granted, have I sometimes exploited a reductive iteration of gender theory to avoid serious moral engagement, do I have a troubled relationship with my body, yes. Do I want to be free of pain and therefore demand that others also live free of pain, the pain that is mine and therefore also theirs, yes, yes.” Then she passes

the train, eating cookies, Rooney and I started talking about religion."],["p","“Even though Christianity is the dominant Western moral framework, the whole idea of self-sacrificing slipped down somehow,” she said. “It’s not really a big part of the conversation about how we should behave. But I find it interesting.”"],["p","I said that I found it interesting, too, but that to really be a Christian you would have to live in a way that not many people are willing to live. I had a hard time reconciling materialism and religion. I didn’t see how anyone could call herself a Christian and have a computer."],["p","“Right, because Christ calls us to give up our earthly belongings,” Rooney said. “But, then, another aspect of Christianity that I find increasingly compelling is that we’re all sinners, but there’s an acceptance that none of us ever lives up to Christ’s image. And so it’s about humility as well as self-sacrifice. It’s about realizing, ‘I’m not doing a very good job of this.’ ”"],["p","After fainting, Frances wakes up in the church. Her mouth tastes bad; she walks to a store and buys two packets of instant noodles and a flavorless chocolate cake. Her sense of spiritual revelation has deserted her. Rooney is alive to the ways that high-flown ideals are constantly punctured by everyday realities. (Even though “Normal People” can feel like a retread at times, Rooney made an intelligent decision in letting her characters work through their sometimes collegiate ideas in actual collegiate settings.) The debater in her is as deft at deflating arguments as she is at constructing them."],["p","To love is to be radically poor in control, and, for Rooney’s characters, humility can tip into humiliation, even masochism. “Was I kind to others?” Frances asks. “It was hard to nail down an answer. I worried that if I did turn out to have a personality, it would be one of the unkind ones. Did I only worry about this question because as a woman I felt required to put the needs of others before my own? Was ‘kindness’ just another term for submission in the face of conflict?” The distinction can be hard to make, especially when altruism is so gendered that a man’s thoughtful act—“Listen, they don’t have red peppers, but is yellow ok?” Nick asks his wife, calling from the grocery store—might seem servile if performed by a woman. Women are often advised to avoid any whiff of abnegation or apologia. Don’t say “sorry”; at the next meeting, let someone else take notes. “I know that in the mid-twentieth century a lot of the goals of feminism were to do with women in the workplace,” Rooney said. “That means that there has been less focus paid to other parts of life.”"],["p","Rooney’s most dazzling argument, her riskiest proposition, is for a sort of transcendence through interdependence. At the end of “Conversations with Friends,” Frances decides to continue her relationship with Nick, despite its deficits. “You live through certain things before you understand them. You can’t always take the analytical position,” she asserts, abandoning herself to the generosity of trust. There is salvation, Rooney seems to be saying, in giving oneself over completely to another person. She is positing a world in which we might stop apologizing for apologizing, in which we might seek compromise and see vulnerability as a form of courage. We might stop protecting ourselves. We might love with bleeding, imperfect hearts. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"59112bb5df652b705f4abe45","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"59112bb5df652b705f4abe45","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Life and Letters","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"life-and-letters"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"Life and Letters","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"life-and-letters"}]}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Lauren Collins","type":"author","title":"Lauren Collins began working at The New Yorker in 2003 and became a staff writer in 2008.

Not surprisingly, feminist dystopian narratives are now enjoying a boom, from Hulu’s television adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Handmaids-Tale-Margaret-Atwood-ebook/dp/B003JFJHTS/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1545416861&sr=1-1&keywords=The+Handmaid%E2%80%99s+Tale"},"The Handmaid’s Tale"],"”—Atwood recently announced that she is writing a sequel—to several books by both new and established novelists, including Louise Erdrich’s “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Future-Home-Living-God-Novel/dp/0062694057/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1545416872&sr=1-1&keywords=Future+Home+of+the+Living+God"},"Future Home of the Living God"],",” Christina Dalcher’s “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Vox-Christina-Dalcher/dp/0440000785/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1545416884&sr=1-1&keywords=Vox%2C"},"Vox,"],"” and Leni Zumas’s “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Red-Clocks-Novel-Leni-Zumas/dp/0316434787/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1545416897&sr=1-1&keywords=Red+Clocks"},"Red Clocks"],".” These writers depict a range of inventively punitive societies: in one, women are punished for speaking more than a hundred words per day; in another, the government takes pregnant women into custody to manage a fertility crisis. The novels extrapolate from a very real prospect of curtailed rights, especially reproductive rights, to imagine what it would be like to live in a society of forced marriages and pregnancies. The typical dystopian novel is at least as much about the world it’s set in as it is about the characters who inhabit it."],["p","Sophie Mackintosh’s clever and arresting début novel, “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Water-Cure-Novel-Sophie-Mackintosh/dp/0385543875/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1545416910&sr=1-1&keywords=The+Water+Cure"},"The Water Cure"],"” (Doubleday), although sometimes grouped with the new crop of feminist dystopias, doesn’t much resemble them in this respect. It constructs not a world but a bubble within a world—in other words, a family. Three young sisters live with their parents in a decommissioned seaside sanatorium that was once a grand hotel. They have no contact with the outside; their father, King, leaves in a motorboat every few months to bring back supplies from a mainland they believe to be dangerously contaminated. Men are the primary source of the toxins, and the two elder sisters can remember when their parents provided a sanctuary for “damaged women,” refugees who had been harmed by the male world. The therapies employed were harsh and primitive: patients were ordered to drink salt water until they vomited, and the titular “water cure” entailed a near-drowning. After the patients stop coming, King and his wife, Mother, administer the same cures to their daughters, observing elaborate purification measures whenever the girls come into contact with dead animals or a particularly noxious artifact from the greater world, such as a magazine. Other regular treatments include being shrouded or gagged with lots of muslin; the characters in “The Water Cure” always seem to be running off to collect a bolt of the stuff."],["p","The middle sister, Lia, narrates the novel’s long central section. It comes bracketed by clusters of short chapters narrated by the eldest, Grace, or by all three sisters collectively, but Lia relates most of what happens after a pivotal event: King fails to return from a supply run. Lia is the one who accepts Mother’s explanation for why her older sister is going to have a baby (“Grace asked the sea for one”), and who, some indistinct period of time after King’s disappearance, describes how two strange men and a boy wash up on the beach after a storm. Lia’s age isn’t clear. She herself doesn’t seem to know it. Grace has few memories of the outside world and Lia, like her younger sister, Sky, has none. Most of what Lia knows comes from her parents. But the unreliability of King and Mother soon becomes unignorable; we learn from Grace that every year the family holds a lottery in which a member draws an iron marker assigning another member to be his or her “loved-most”—and, since there are five of them, one person always gets left out. Among the cruellest tests the parents impose is to make one of the two elder sisters kill some small animal in order to spare the youngest from being forced to do it. It’s an exercise meant to harden their hearts to everything but each other. Throughout most of “The Water Cure,” the reader can’t tell whether the daughters really are refugees from a poisoned apocalyptic future or just the unwitting captives of a tiny crackpot separatist cult."],["p","Lia is a narrator familiar from many coming-of-age novels: needy, solipsistic, obsessed with her own body and feelings, absorbed in a morbid form of femininity that prompts her to cut and burn herself. In another era, she would have been called a hysteric and sent away to a more overtly patriarchal version of the sanatorium her parents once operated. Some readers can’t get enough of characters like this, but I confess that Lia often exasperated me and even made me contemplate abandoning the novel once or twice. That would have been a lamentable mistake, for Mackintosh is up to something far more interesting than a celebration of female dysfunction. Still, I sometimes longed for the narrative reins to be returned to the more hardheaded and clear-eyed Grace."],["p","Having drawn the short straw in the family’s most recent lottery, Lia is nobody’s loved-most. She craves tenderness so desperately that it drives her and everyone around her half mad. “Often Grace is repelled by me,” she explains. “I don’t have the luxury of being repelled by her, even when her breath is sour and a gentle scum of dirt clings to her ankles. I take whatever contact I can get. Sometimes I harvest the hair from her brush and hide it under my pillow, when things get very bad.” She can think of nothing else, even as she’s acutely aware of how dangerous her loneliness is. As her parents frame it, the sickness men cause in women takes the form of women’s emotions. “Part of what made the old world so terrible,” Lia explains, “so prone to destruction, was a total lack of preparation for the personal energies often called feelings. . . . Especially dangerous for women, our bodies already so vulnerable in ways that the bodies of men are not.” The “cures” King and Mother administer are meant to purge their daughters of all but a narrow range of feeling, making their sanctuary uncomfortably similar to nineteenth- and twentieth-century institutions designed to render wayward girls and women mild and docile helpmeets. When Grace’s baby is born dead, Mother allows the girls to cry for only five minutes, covered in heavy sheets, “for your grief.”"]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EThe%20humid%20claustrophobia%20of%20Lia%E2%80%99s%20perspective%20shuts%20out%20any%20possibility%20of%20conventional%20political%20commentary%20about%2C%20for%20example%2C%20the%20perils%20of%20theocratic%20governments%20or%20the%20failure%20of%20previous%20generations%20to%20forestall%20an%20ecological%20disaster.%20This%20insularity%20gives%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Water%20Cure%E2%80%9D%20the%20cloistered%2C%20ahistorical%20atmosphere%20of%20a%20fairy%20tale%2C%20where%20elemental%20dramas%20play%20out%20much%20as%20they%20have%20since%20humanity%20first%20began%20telling%20stories.%20Salt%2C%20one%20of%20the%20family%E2%80%99s%20go-to%20remedies%2C%20was%20traditionally%20reputed%20to%20keep%20away%20malicious%20fairies%2C%20and%20the%20overgrown%20grounds%20Lia%20wanders%20through%2C%20with%20their%20perimeter%20of%20rusty%20barbed%20wire%20and%20shark-infested%20waters%2C%20resemble%20Sleeping%20Beauty%E2%80%99s%20castle.%20The%20Shakespearean%20allusions%E2%80%94Lear-like%20King%20with%20his%20three%20daughters%3B%20shipwrecked%20sailors%20delivered%2C%20%E2%80%9C%3Ca%20href%3D%5C%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTempest-Folger-Shakespeare-Library%2Fdp%2F0743482832%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fs%3Dbooks%26amp%3Bie%3DUTF8%26amp%3Bqid%3D1545416944%26amp%3Bsr%3D1-1%26amp%3Bkeywords%3DTempest%2Bshakespeare%5C%22%3ETempest%3C%2Fa%3E%E2%80%9D%20style%2C%20into%20a%20tiny%20fiefdom%E2%80%94and%20the%20absence%20of%20any%20modern%20technology%20contribute%20to%20the%20novel%E2%80%99s%20timeless%20languor.%20It%20could%20as%20easily%20be%20set%20fifty%20years%20ago%20as%20fifty%20years%20from%20now.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EAt%20first%2C%20King%E2%80%99s%20women%20regard%20the%20castaways%20with%20alarm.%20Surely%20they%20must%20be%20carriers%20of%20contagion.%20A%20moldering%20volume%20called%20the%20Welcome%20Book%2C%20left%20over%20from%20the%20sanatorium%20days%2C%20serves%20to%20remind%20them%20of%20the%20threat%3B%20snippets%20of%20the%20volume%20are%20scattered%20through%20the%20novel.%20(%E2%80%9CEverybody%20knew%20and%20nobody%20helped.%20It%20was%20the%20secret%20that%20we%20were%20all%20choking%20on.%E2%80%9D)%20Yet%20the%20newcomers%20have%20an%20unself-conscious%20ease%20that%20fascinates%20Lia.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3E%E2%80%9CThere%20is%20a%20fluidity%20to%20his%20movements%2C%20despite%20his%20size%2C%20that%20tells%20me%20he%20has%20never%20had%20to%20justify%20his%20existence%2C%20has%20never%20had%20to%20fold%20himself%20into%20a%20hidden%20thing%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20observes%20of%20one%20of%20the%20elder%20pair%2C%20Llew%2C%20%E2%80%9Cand%20I%20wonder%20what%20that%20must%20be%20like%2C%20to%20know%20that%20your%20body%20is%20irreproachable.%E2%80%9D%20He%20sizes%20her%20up%20as%20the%20likeliest%20candidate%20for%20seduction%2C%20and%2C%20of%20course%2C%20she%20succumbs%3A%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cblockquote%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EI%20know%20that%20without%20being%20touched%20I%20will%20die.%20I%20have%20known%20it%20for%20some%20time.%20It%20has%20always%20felt%20like%20I%20need%20more%20touch%20than%20the%20others%20anyway%2C%20my%20hands%20brushing%20over%20their%20shoulders%20or%20the%20tops%20of%20their%20heads%20as%20they%20shy%20away%2C%20because%20nobody%20is%20assigned%20to%20me.%20I%20am%20not%20anybody%E2%80%99s%20loved-most%2C%20have%20not%20been%20for%20some%20time.%20I%20have%20gone%20days%2C%20weeks%2C%20without%20touch%20and%20when%20that%20happens%20I%20can%20feel%20my%20skin%20thinning%2C%20I%20have%20to%20lay%20my%20body%20against%20grass%20and%20velvet%20and%20the%20corner%20of%20the%20sofa%20and%20rub%20my%20hands%20and%20elbows%20and%20thighs%20against%20anything%20until%20they%20are%20raw.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3C%2Fblockquote%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EOne%20day%2C%20Mother%2C%20too%2C%20vanishes%2C%20and%20the%20old%20order%20and%20its%20barriers%20crumble%20further.%20The%20lovers%20sneak%20off%20into%20the%20woods%20for%20a%20tryst%2C%20Lia%20revelling%20in%20the%20vulnerability%20she%E2%80%99s%20been%20raised%20to%20conquer%3B%20she%20finds%20herself%20%E2%80%9Con%20my%20hands%20and%20knees%20and%20I%20know%20that%20bruises%20will%20come%20up%20almost%20immediately%2C%20that%20I%20am%20thin-skinned%20and%20woundable%2C%20and%20somewhere%20within%20me%20I%20like%20this%2C%20the%20proof%2C%20the%20map%20of%20this%20new%20joy.%E2%80%9D%20But%2C%20just%20as%20she%20is%20no%20Miranda%2C%20Llew%20is%20no%20Ferdinand%20and%20theirs%20is%20no%20brave%20new%20world.%20When%20he%20begins%20to%20pull%20away%2C%20the%20dreamy%2C%20primal%20language%20of%20the%20novel%20splits%20open%20on%20the%20prosaic%2C%20familiar%20edge%20of%20his%20evasions.%20He%20says%20things%20like%20%E2%80%9CI%20hate%20it%20when%20women%20cry.%20It%E2%80%99s%20manipulative%E2%80%9D%20and%20%E2%80%9CYou%E2%80%99re%20taking%20precautions%2C%20aren%E2%80%99t%20you%3F%E2%80%9D%20(She%20has%20no%20idea%20what%20this%20means%2C%20and%20he%E2%80%99s%20asking%20way%20

humid claustrophobia of Lia’s perspective shuts out any possibility of conventional political commentary about, for example, the perils of theocratic governments or the failure of previous generations to forestall an ecological disaster. This insularity gives “The Water Cure” the cloistered, ahistorical atmosphere of a fairy tale, where elemental dramas play out much as they have since humanity first began telling stories. Salt, one of the family’s go-to remedies, was traditionally reputed to keep away malicious fairies, and the overgrown grounds Lia wanders through, with their perimeter of rusty barbed wire and shark-infested waters, resemble Sleeping Beauty’s castle. The Shakespearean allusions—Lear-like King with his three daughters; shipwrecked sailors delivered, “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Tempest-Folger-Shakespeare-Library/dp/0743482832/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1545416944&sr=1-1&keywords=Tempest+shakespeare"},"Tempest"],"” style, into a tiny fiefdom—and the absence of any modern technology contribute to the novel’s timeless languor. It could as easily be set fifty years ago as fifty years from now."],["p","At first, King’s women regard the castaways with alarm. Surely they must be carriers of contagion. A moldering volume called the Welcome Book, left over from the sanatorium days, serves to remind them of the threat; snippets of the volume are scattered through the novel. (“Everybody knew and nobody helped. It was the secret that we were all choking on.”) Yet the newcomers have an unself-conscious ease that fascinates Lia."],["p","“There is a fluidity to his movements, despite his size, that tells me he has never had to justify his existence, has never had to fold himself into a hidden thing,” she observes of one of the elder pair, Llew, “and I wonder what that must be like, to know that your body is irreproachable.” He sizes her up as the likeliest candidate for seduction, and, of course, she succumbs:"],["blockquote",["p","I know that without being touched I will die. I have known it for some time. It has always felt like I need more touch than the others anyway, my hands brushing over their shoulders or the tops of their heads as they shy away, because nobody is assigned to me. I am not anybody’s loved-most, have not been for some time. I have gone days, weeks, without touch and when that happens I can feel my skin thinning, I have to lay my body against grass and velvet and the corner of the sofa and rub my hands and elbows and thighs against anything until they are raw."]],["p","One day, Mother, too, vanishes, and the old order and its barriers crumble further. The lovers sneak off into the woods for a tryst, Lia revelling in the vulnerability she’s been raised to conquer; she finds herself “on my hands and knees and I know that bruises will come up almost immediately, that I am thin-skinned and woundable, and somewhere within me I like this, the proof, the map of this new joy.” But, just as she is no Miranda, Llew is no Ferdinand and theirs is no brave new world. When he begins to pull away, the dreamy, primal language of the novel splits open on the prosaic, familiar edge of his evasions. He says things like “I hate it when women cry. It’s manipulative” and “You’re taking precautions, aren’t you?” (She has no idea what this means, and he’s asking way too late.) Worst of all, “I thought you might not be like the rest of them.” As Grace will later put it, “Refrain of the man, universal: This is not my fault! See also: I absolve myself of responsibility. And: I never said that. You can’t take the actions of my body as words.”"],["p","After the predictable ruination of Lia’s hopes comes an unexpected and thrilling turn. Wised-up Grace takes over the narration. She addresses her account directly to King, the architect of their lives and the father of her dead child. “There has never been anyone like you in the world,” she recalls him saying once, exulting in his own achievement in raising her and her sisters. “Well, I wouldn’t know about that, would I?” she replies. Unlike Lia, Grace is well equipped to discover the true nature of her family’s circumstances. But of all the revelations that follow, as the sisters prepare to dismantle the only life they’ve known, the most darkly gratifying concerns the terrible strength that lies at the heart of Lia’s weakness. Ingenious and incendiary, “The Water Cure” is less a warning about the way we live now, the hazardous path society is careering down, than it is about the way we have always lived, parents and children, fathers and daughters, men and women. As the sisters put it, when they are again able to speak as one, “The safe place had been contaminated from the start.” ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59babd482af19b1403458545","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"59babd482af19b1403458545","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"Books","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"books"},{"id":"5907ef77019dfc3494e9c911","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[],"photos":{},"slug":"books-tag"}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Laura

Avedisian, a litigator and situational genius, lives on an Upper East Side residential block with its share of wildlife. At some point, virtually every New York City building not recently constructed and exactingly sealed has—within the walls, or burrowing in the basement—mice. The co-op apartment that Avedisian occupies with his wife, Carla van de Walle, and their two children, in a six-story prewar building, is meticulously tidy. Still, mice. Last March, Avedisian sent the first in a series of e-mails to fellow-members of the co-op’s board, itemizing sightings (or droppings)—under the refrigerator, inside cupboards, in a knife drawer, sleeping it off in a garbage can, running free in daylight, drunk on the fragrance of sizzling bacon."],["p","The month had begun on a more propitious note, when Avedisian was announced as a winner of the Metropolitan Transit Authority’s “genius challenge,” a competition that solicited ideas for ways to render subway service less insane-making. The M.T.A. offered a million dollars in prize money in each of three categories, and Avedisian emerged from four hundred and thirty-eight entrants. The only winner with no ties to the transit industry, he proposed easing congestion and delays by deploying longer (and thus fewer) trains, with only some cars (color-coded) opening at certain stations. It bears mentioning that Avedisian’s idea became a punching bag for many in the online mass-transit-nerd community. Also, that the check, for three hundred and thirty-three thousand dollars, cleared."],["p","Back home, the mice—probably expats from a building renovation next door—became more brazen. Corroborating e-mails circulated: “First of all, I find having to have this discussion repulsive. . . . I have terminated 6 mice this week. . . . I’m really grossed out, fed up.” A neighbor suggested investing in extra-long cats. Instead, Avedisian and van de Walle placed glue traps and spring traps all over the kitchen. The spring traps occasionally sprang. The building super patched openings behind the range, the dishwasher, and the cabinets with plaster and fine wire mesh. The problem persisted—June, July, August, September. An exterminating company, M. & M. Pest Control, sealed overlooked fissures in cabinet joints and along baseboards. By fall, Avedisian and Timothy Wong, of M. & M., believed that landmark progress had been achieved—that from a mice situation they were down to a mouse situation. A single intruder, all avenues of egress sealed, was now trapped in the apartment, an accidental pet. Avedisian named him Horace, an homage to the building’s architect, Horace Ginsbern."],["p","To test the hypothesis, M. & M. built a two-foot-high cardboard divider that walled off the kitchen doorway, and Avedisian bought an infrared night-vision security camera that could be monitored from a smartphone. The night that he installed it in the kitchen, he and van de Walle sat up in bed, constantly checking Avedisian’s phone. Around 1:30 ",["em",{"class":"small"},"A.M."],", Avedisian spotted Horace and knew that he was under-equipped. An intrepid interpreter of instruction manuals, he figured out how to make a cloud-based service send alerts to his phone whenever the camera captured a rodent in motion. Reviewing the footage, he identified the kitchen range as one of the off-camera portals of Horace’s entrances and exits. He arranged “a Maginot Line of glue traps” and set out a pizza box with a mouse-size hole and, inside, pieces of mozzarella and pepperoni surrounded by glue traps. This yielded maddening footage of Horace entering the pizza box and, moments later, sauntering out. “We were pissed,” Avedisian said recently. “We’d left a feast for him. He somehow avoided the glue. He’s walking around like he owns the place.”"],["p","In October, Avedisian e-mailed Wong, embedding links to several videos: “We have had at least one mouse [sighting] each night . . . Friday (35 seconds in) . . . Saturday . . . 3:41 ",["em",{"class":"small"},"A.M."]," (1 min 23 seconds in, from wall on right darting under range) . . . 3:53 ",["em",{"class":"small"},"A.M."]," (50 seconds in, from bottom of screen) . . . 4:09 ",["em",{"class":"small"},"A.M."]," (25 seconds in, in the middle of the screen, roams, approaches glue traps).” M. & M. returned and deepened the Maginot Line, and two days later Avedisian wrote to the co-op board: “We finally caught [Horace] last night. A huge array of glue traps around the kitchen is what finally did the trick. . . . Here is a link to the capture last night at about 11:40 ",["em",{"class":"small"},"P.M."],"” [Editor’s note: ",["em",{"class":"small"},"PETA"],", if you’re reading, Horace has gone upstate to live on a farm with a nice family.]"],["p","The cardboard wall came down, and Avedisian is busy trying to collect on a large judgment he won in late 2017. If not, he has a fallback. “The holy grail of the M.T.A. is a single-seat ride to J.F.K.,” he said. “You get on the subway in, say, Manhattan and get off at your terminal at J.F.K. without changing trains. Nobody’s been able to figure out how to do it. I believe I have. Two different ways.” ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7e81ab3335f580f176","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mice","parent":[],"photos":{},"slug":"mice"},{"id":"5c2e1c7e2bfcc72cd92d0530","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mousetraps","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mousetraps"},{"id":"5c2e1c7e2bfcc72cd92d052f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Craig Avedisian","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"craig-avedisian"},{"id":"5c2e1c7e2396212cbb9fc99f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Subways","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"subways"},{"id":"5c2e1c7936cecf40192141c9","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"New York City","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"new-york-city"},{"id":"5c2e1c7e41c92e2c9b85da24","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Apartments","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"apartments"},{"id":"5c2e1c7c7e716b454591adac","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"category_culture","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"category-culture"},{"id":"5c2e1c7e4a08312cd3aa6c44","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"M.T.A.","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mta"},{"id":"5c2e1c7e2396212cbb9fc9a0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Metropolitan Transit Authority","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"metropolitan-transit-authority"},{"id":"5c2e1c7e2bc86f2c9a2449a8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Exterminators","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"exterminators"},{"id":"5c2e1c7e2bfcc72cd92d0531","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Pest Control","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"pest-control"},{"id":"5c2e1c7e2bc86f2c9a2449a9","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Public Transit","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"public-transit"}],"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"591bb1e7ccc2bd451f5eb218","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"591bb1e7ccc2bd451f5eb218","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Ingenuity Dept.","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"ingenuity-dept"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"Ingenuity Dept.","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"ingenuity-dept"}]}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[{"name":"Mice","url":"/tag/mice"},{"name":"Mousetraps","url":"/tag/mousetraps"},{"name":"Craig Avedisian","url":"/tag/craig-avedisian"},{"name":"Subways","url":"/tag/subways"}],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Mark Singer","type":"author","title":"Mark Singer, a longtime contributor to the magazine, is the author of several books, including “Character Studies.”","email":"","bio":["div",["p","Mark Singer has been a staff writer at ",["em","The New Yorker"]," since 1974.

Robinson,” a Swedish reality-television program, premièred in the summer of 1997, with a tantalizing premise: sixteen strangers are deposited on a small island off the coast of Malaysia and forced to fend for themselves. To survive, they must coöperate, but they are also competing: each week, a member of the ensemble is voted off the island, and the final contestant wins a grand prize. The show’s title alluded to both “Robinson Crusoe” and “The Swiss Family Robinson,” but a more apt literary reference might have been “Lord of the Flies.” The first contestant who was kicked off was a young man named Sinisa Savija. Upon returning to Sweden, he was morose, complaining to his wife that the show’s editors would “cut away the good things I did and make me look like a fool.” Nine weeks before the show aired, he stepped in front of a speeding train."],["p","The producers dealt with this tragedy by suggesting that Savija’s turmoil was unrelated to the series—and by editing him virtually out of the show. Even so, there was a backlash, with one critic asserting that a program based on such merciless competition was “fascist television.” But everyone watched the show anyway, and Savija was soon forgotten. “We had never seen anything like it,” Svante Stockselius, the chief of the network that produced the program, told the Los Angeles ",["em","Times"],", in 2000. “Expedition: Robinson” offered a potent cocktail of repulsion and attraction. You felt embarrassed watching it, Stockselius said, but “you couldn’t stop.”"],["p","In 1998, a thirty-eight-year-old former British paratrooper named Mark Burnett was living in Los Angeles, producing television. “Lord of the Flies” was one of his favorite books, and after he heard about “Expedition: Robinson” he secured the rights to make an American version. Burnett had previously worked in sales and had a knack for branding. He renamed the show “Survivor.”"],["p","The first season was set in Borneo, and from the moment it aired, on CBS, in 2000, “Survivor” was a ratings juggernaut: according to the network, a hundred and twenty-five million Americans—more than a third of the population—tuned in for some portion of the season finale. The catchphrase delivered by the host, Jeff Probst, at the end of each elimination ceremony, “The tribe has spoken,” entered the lexicon. Burnett had been a marginal figure in Hollywood, but after this triumph he, too, was rebranded, as an oracle of spectacle. Les Moonves, then the chairman of CBS, arranged for the delivery of a token of thanks—a champagne-colored Mercedes. To Burnett, the meaning of this gesture was unmistakable: “I had arrived.” The only question was what he might do next."],["p","A few years later, Burnett was in Brazil, filming “Survivor: The Amazon.” His second marriage was falling apart, and he was staying in a corporate apartment with a girlfriend. One day, they were watching TV and happened across a BBC documentary series called “Trouble at the Top,” about the corporate rat race. The girlfriend found the show boring and suggested changing the station, but Burnett was transfixed. He called his business partner in L.A. and said, “I’ve got a new idea.” Burnett would not discuss the concept over the phone—one of his rules for success was to always pitch in person—but he was certain that the premise had the contours of a hit: “Survivor” in the city. Contestants competing for a corporate job. The ",["em","urban"]," jungle!"],["p","He needed someone to play the role of heavyweight tycoon. Burnett, who tends to narrate stories from his own life in the bravura language of a Hollywood pitch, once said of the show, “It’s got to have a hook to it, right? They’ve got to be working for someone big and special and important. Cut to: I’ve rented this skating rink.”"],["p","In 2002, Burnett rented Wollman Rink, in Central Park, for a live broadcast of the Season 4 finale of “Survivor.” The property was controlled by Donald Trump, who had obtained the lease to operate the rink in 1986, and had plastered his name on it. Before the segment started, Burnett addressed fifteen hundred spectators who had been corralled for the occasion, and noticed Trump sitting with Melania Knauss, then his girlfriend, in the front row. Burnett prides himself on his ability to “read the room”: to size up the personalities in his audience, suss out what they want, and then give it to them."],["p","“I need to show respect to Mr. Trump,” Burnett recounted, in a 2013 speech in Vancouver. “I said, ‘Welcome, everybody, to ",["em","Trump"]," Wollman skating rink. The ",["em","Trump"]," Wollman skating rink is a fine facility, built by Mr. Donald Trump. Thank you, Mr. Trump. Because the ",["em","Trump"]," Wollman skating rink is the place we are tonight and we love being at the ",["em","Trump"]," Wollman skating rink, Mr. Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump.” As Burnett told the story, he had scarcely got offstage before Trump was shaking his hand, proclaiming, “You’re a genius!”"],["p","Cut to: June, 2015. After starring in fourteen seasons of “The Apprentice,” all executive-produced by Burnett, Trump appeared in the gilded atrium of Trump Tower, on Fifth Avenue, to announce that he was running for President. Only someone “really rich,” Trump declared, could “take the brand of the United States and make it great again.” He also made racist remarks about Mexicans, prompting NBC, which had broadcast “The Apprentice,” to fire him. Burnett, however, did not sever his relationship with his star. He and Trump had been equal partners in “The Apprentice,” and the show had made each of them hundreds of millions of dollars. They were also close friends: Burnett liked to tell people that when Trump married Knauss, in 2005, Burnett’s son Cameron was the ring bearer."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5c1af294d2db9849ec9e4265%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225c1af294d2db9849ec9e4265%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F5c1af294d2db9849ec9e4265%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5c1af294d2db9849ec9e4265"}]],["p","Trump had been a celebrity since the eighties, his persona shaped by the best-selling book “The Art of the Deal.” But his business had foundered, and by 2003 he had become a garish figure of local interest—a punch line on Page Six. “The Apprentice” mythologized him anew, and on a much bigger scale, turning him into an icon of American success. Jay Bienstock, a longtime collaborator of Burnett’s, and the showrunner on “The Apprentice,” told me, “Mark always likes to compare his shows to great films or novels. All of Mark’s shows feel bigger than life, and this is by design.” Burnett has made many programs since “The Apprentice,” among them “Shark Tank,” a startup competition based on a Japanese show, and “The Voice,” a singing contest adapted from a Dutch program. In June, he became the chairman of M-G-M Television. But his chief legacy is to have cast a serially bankrupt carnival barker in the role of a man who might plausibly become the leader of the free world. “I don’t think any of us could have known what this would become,” Katherine Walker, a producer on the first five seasons of “The Apprentice,” told me. “But Donald would not be President had it not been for that show.”"],["p","Tony Schwartz, who wrote “The Art of the Deal,” which falsely presented Trump as its primary author, told me that he feels some responsibility for facilitating Trump’s imposture. But, he said, “Mark Burnett’s influence was vastly greater,” adding, “ ‘The Apprentice’ was the single biggest factor in putting Trump in the national spotlight.” Schwartz has publicly condemned Trump, describing him as “the monster I helped to create.” Burnett, by contrast, has refused to speak publicly about his relationship with the President or about his curious, but decisive, role in American history."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EBurnett%20is%20lean%20and%20lanky%2C%20with%20the%20ageless%2C%20perpetually%20smiling%20face%20of%20Peter%20Pan%20and%20eyes%20that%2C%20in%20the%20words%20of%20one%20ex-wife%2C%20have%20%E2%80%9Ca%20Photoshop%20twinkle.%E2%80%9D%20He%20has%20a%20high%20forehead%20and%20the%20fixed%2C%20gravity-defying%20hair%20of%20a%20nineteen-fifties%20film%20star.%20People%20often%20mistake%20Burnett%20for%20an%20Australian%2C%20because%20he%20has%20a%20deep%20tan%20and%20an%20outdoorsy%20disposition%2C%20and%20because%20his%20accent%20has%20been%20mongrelized%20by%20years%20of%20international%20travel.%20But%20he%20grew%20up%20in%20Dagenham%2C%20on%20the%20eastern%20outskirts%20of%20London%2C%20a%20milieu%20that%20he%20has%20recalled%20as%20%E2%80%9Cgray%20and%20grimy.%E2%80%9D%20His%20father%2C%20Archie%2C%20was%20a%20tattooed%20Glaswegian%20who%20worked%20the%20night%20shift%20at%20a%20Ford%20automobile%20plant.%20His%20mother%2C%20Jean%2C%20worked%20there%20as%20well%2C%20pouring%20acid%20into%20batteries%2C%20but%20in%20Mark%E2%80%99s%20recollection%20she%20always%20dressed%20immaculately%2C%20%E2%80%9Cnever%20letting%20her%20station%20in%20life%20interfere%20with%20how%20she%20presented%20herself.%E2%80%9D%20Mark%2C%20an%20only%20child%2C%20grew%20up%20watching%20American%20television%20shows%20such%20as%20%E2%80%9CStarsky%20%26amp%3B%20Hutch%E2%80%9D%20and%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Rockford%20Files.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EAt%20seventeen%2C%20he%20volunteered%20for%20the%20British%20Army%E2%80%99s%20Parachute%20Regiment%3B%20according%20to%20a%20friend%20who%20enlisted%20with%20him%2C%20he%20joined%20for%20%E2%80%9Cthe%20glitz.%E2%80%9D%20The%20Paras%20were%20an%20%C3%A9lite%20unit%2C%20and%20a%20soldier%20from%20his%20platoon%2C%20Paul%20Read%2C%20told%20me%20that%20Burnett%20was%20a%20particularly%20formidable%20special%20operator%2C%20both%20physically%20commanding%20and%20a%20natural%20leader%3A%20%E2%80%9CHe%20was%20always%20super%20keen.%20He%20always%20wanted%20to%20be%20the%20best%2C%20even%20among%20the%20best.%E2%80%9D%20(Another%20soldier%20recalled%20that%20Burnett%20was%20nicknamed%20the%20Male%20Model%2C%20because%20he%20was%20reluctant%20to%20%E2%80%9Cget%20any%20dirt%20under%20his%20fingernails.%E2%80%9D)%20Burnett%20served%20in%20Northern%20Ireland%2C%20and%20then%20in%20the%20Falklands%2C%20where%20he%20took%20part%20in%20the%201982%20advance%20on%20Port%20Stanley.%20The%20experience%2C%20he%20later%20said%2C%20was%20%E2%80%9Chorrific%2C%20but%20on%20the%20other%20hand%E2%80%94in%20a%20sick%20way%E2%80%94exciting.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EWhen%20Burnett%20left%20the%20Army%2C%20after%20five%20years%2C%20his%20plan%20was%20to%20find%20work%20in%20Central%20America%20as%20a%20%E2%80%9Cweapons%20and%20tactics%20adviser%E2%80%9D%E2%80%94not%20as%20a%20mercenary%2C%20he%20later%20insisted%2C%20though%20it%20is%20difficult%20to%20parse%20the%20distinction.%20Before%20he%20left%2C%20his%20mother%20told%20him%20that%20she%E2%80%99d%20had%20a%20premonition%20and%20implored%20him%20not%20to%20take%20another%20job%20that%20involved%20carrying%20a%20gun.%20Like%20Trump%2C%20Burnett%20trusts%20his%20impulses.%20%E2%80%9CYour%20gut%20instinct%20is%20rarely%20wrong%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20likes%20to%20say.%20During%20a%20layover%20in%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20he%20decided%20to%20heed%20his%20mother%E2%80%99s%20admonition%2C%20and%20walked%20out%20of%20the%20airport.%20He%20later%20described%20himself%20as%20the%20quintessential%20immigrant%3A%20%E2%80%9CI%20had%20no%20money%2C%20no%20green%20card%2C%20no%20nothing.%E2%80%9D%20But%20the%20California%20sun%20was%20shining%2C%20and%20he%20was%20eager%20to%20try%20his%20luck.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EBurnett%20is%20an%20avid%20raconteur%2C%20and%20his%20anecdotes%20about%20his%20life%20tend%20to%20have%20a%20three-act%20structure.%20In%20Act%20I%2C%20he%20is%20a%20fish%20out%20of%20water%2C%20guileless%20and%20na%C3%AFve%2C%20with%20nothing%20but%20the%20shirt%20on%20his%20back%20and%20an%20outsized%20dream.%20Act%20II%20is%20the%20rude%20awakening%3A%20the%20world%20bets%20against%20him.%20%3Cem%3EIt%E2%80%99s%20impossible!%20You%E2%80%99ll%20lose%20everything!%20No%20such%20thing%20has%20ever%20been%20tried!%3C%2Fem%3E%20In%20Act%20III%2C%20Burnett%20always%20prevails.%20Not%20long%20after%20arriving%20in%20California%2C%20he%20landed%20his%20first%20job%E2%80%94as%20a%20nanny.%20Eyebrows%20were%20raised%3A%20a%20commando%20turned%20nanny%3F%20Yet%20Burnett%20thrived%2C%20working%20for%20a%20family%20in%20Beverly%20Hills%2C%20then%20one%20in%20Malibu.%20As%20he%20later%20observed%2C%20the%20experience%20taught%20him%20%E2%80%9Chow%20nice%20the%20life%20styles%20of%20wealthy%20people%20are.%E2%80%9D%20Young%2C%20handsome%2C%20and%20solicitous%2C%20he%20discovered%20that%20successful%20people%20are%20often%20happy%20to%20talk%20about%20their%20path%20to%20success.%3C%2Fp

is lean and lanky, with the ageless, perpetually smiling face of Peter Pan and eyes that, in the words of one ex-wife, have “a Photoshop twinkle.” He has a high forehead and the fixed, gravity-defying hair of a nineteen-fifties film star. People often mistake Burnett for an Australian, because he has a deep tan and an outdoorsy disposition, and because his accent has been mongrelized by years of international travel. But he grew up in Dagenham, on the eastern outskirts of London, a milieu that he has recalled as “gray and grimy.” His father, Archie, was a tattooed Glaswegian who worked the night shift at a Ford automobile plant. His mother, Jean, worked there as well, pouring acid into batteries, but in Mark’s recollection she always dressed immaculately, “never letting her station in life interfere with how she presented herself.” Mark, an only child, grew up watching American television shows such as “Starsky & Hutch” and “The Rockford Files.”"],["p","At seventeen, he volunteered for the British Army’s Parachute Regiment; according to a friend who enlisted with him, he joined for “the glitz.” The Paras were an élite unit, and a soldier from his platoon, Paul Read, told me that Burnett was a particularly formidable special operator, both physically commanding and a natural leader: “He was always super keen. He always wanted to be the best, even among the best.” (Another soldier recalled that Burnett was nicknamed the Male Model, because he was reluctant to “get any dirt under his fingernails.”) Burnett served in Northern Ireland, and then in the Falklands, where he took part in the 1982 advance on Port Stanley. The experience, he later said, was “horrific, but on the other hand—in a sick way—exciting.”"],["p","When Burnett left the Army, after five years, his plan was to find work in Central America as a “weapons and tactics adviser”—not as a mercenary, he later insisted, though it is difficult to parse the distinction. Before he left, his mother told him that she’d had a premonition and implored him not to take another job that involved carrying a gun. Like Trump, Burnett trusts his impulses. “Your gut instinct is rarely wrong,” he likes to say. During a layover in Los Angeles, he decided to heed his mother’s admonition, and walked out of the airport. He later described himself as the quintessential immigrant: “I had no money, no green card, no nothing.” But the California sun was shining, and he was eager to try his luck."],["p","Burnett is an avid raconteur, and his anecdotes about his life tend to have a three-act structure. In Act I, he is a fish out of water, guileless and naïve, with nothing but the shirt on his back and an outsized dream. Act II is the rude awakening: the world bets against him. ",["em","It’s impossible! You’ll lose everything! No such thing has ever been tried!"]," In Act III, Burnett always prevails. Not long after arriving in California, he landed his first job—as a nanny. Eyebrows were raised: a commando turned nanny? Yet Burnett thrived, working for a family in Beverly Hills, then one in Malibu. As he later observed, the experience taught him “how nice the life styles of wealthy people are.” Young, handsome, and solicitous, he discovered that successful people are often happy to talk about their path to success."],["p","Burnett married a California woman, Kym Gold, who came from an affluent family. “Mark has always been very, very hungry,” Gold told me recently. “He’s always had a lot of drive.” For a time, he worked for Gold’s stepfather, who owned a casting agency, and for Gold, who owned an apparel business. She would buy slightly imperfect T-shirts wholesale, at two dollars apiece, and Burnett would resell them, on the Venice boardwalk, for eighteen. That was where he learned “the art of selling,” he has said. The marriage lasted only a year, by which point Burnett had obtained a green card. (Gold, who had also learned a thing or two about selling, went on to co-found the denim company True Religion, which was eventually sold for eight hundred million dollars.)"],["p","One day in the early nineties, Burnett read an article about a new kind of athletic event: a long-distance endurance race, known as the Raid Gauloises, in which teams of athletes competed in a multiday trek over harsh terrain. In 1992, Burnett organized a team and participated in a race in Oman. Noticing that he and his teammates were “walking, climbing advertisements” for gear, he signed up sponsors. He also realized that if you filmed such a race it would make for exotic and gripping viewing. Burnett launched his own race, the Eco-Challenge, which was set in such scenic locations as Utah and British Columbia, and was televised on various outlets, including the Discovery Channel. Bienstock, who first met Burnett when he worked on the “Eco-Challenge” show, in 1996, told me that Burnett was less interested in the ravishing backdrops or in the competition than he was in the intense emotional experiences of the racers: “Mark saw the drama in real people being the driving force in an unscripted show.”"],["p","By this time, Burnett had met an aspiring actress from Long Island named Dianne Minerva and married her. They became consumed with making the show a success. “When we went to bed at night, we talked about it, when we woke up in the morning, we talked about it,” Dianne Burnett told me recently. In the small world of adventure racing, Mark developed a reputation as a slick and ambitious operator. “He’s like a rattlesnake,” one of his business competitors told the New York ",["em","Times"]," in 2000. “If you’re close enough long enough, you’re going to get bit.” Mark and Dianne were doing far better than Mark’s parents ever had, but he was restless. One day, they attended a seminar by the motivational speaker Tony Robbins called “Unleash the Power Within.” A good technique for realizing your goals, Robbins counselled, was to write down what you wanted most on index cards, then deposit them around your house, as constant reminders.

a young man, Burnett occasionally found himself on a flight for business, looking at the other passengers and daydreaming: If this plane were to crash on a desert island, where would I fit into our new society? Who would lead and who would follow? “Nature strips away the veneer we show one another every day, at which point people become who they really are,” Burnett once wrote. He has long espoused a Hobbesian world view, and when he launched “Survivor” a zero-sum ethos was integral to the show. “It’s quite a mean game, just like life is kind of a mean game,” Burnett told CNN, in 2001. “Everyone’s out for themselves.”"],["p","On “Survivor,” the competitors were split into teams, or “tribes.” In this raw arena, Burnett suggested, viewers could glimpse the cruel essence of human nature. It was undeniably compelling to watch contestants of different ages, body types, and dispositions negotiate the primordial challenges of making fire, securing shelter, and foraging for food. At the same time, the scenario was extravagantly contrived: the castaways were shadowed by camera crews, and helicopters thundered around the island, gathering aerial shots."],["p","Moreover, the contestants had been selected for their charisma and their combustibility. “It’s all about casting,” Burnett once observed. “As a producer, my job is to make the choices in who to work with and put on camera.” He was always searching for someone with the sort of personality that could “break through the clutter.” In casting sessions, Burnett sometimes goaded people, to see how they responded to conflict. Katherine Walker, the “Apprentice” producer, told me about an audition in which Burnett taunted a prospective cast member by insinuating that he was secretly gay. (The man, riled, threw the accusation back at Burnett, and was not cast that season.)"],["p","Richard Levak, a clinical psychologist who consulted for Burnett on “Survivor” and “The Apprentice” and worked on other reality-TV shows, told me that producers have often liked people he was uncomfortable with for psychological reasons. Emotional volatility makes for compelling television. But recruiting individuals for their instability and then subjecting them to the stress of a televised competition can be perilous. When Burnett was once asked about Sinisa Savija’s suicide, he contended that Savija had “previous psychological problems.” No “Survivor” or “Apprentice” contestants are known to have killed themselves, but in the past two decades several dozen reality-TV participants have. Levak eventually stopped consulting on such programs, in part because he feared that a contestant might harm himself. “I would think, Geez, if this should unravel, they’re going to look at the personality profile and there may have been a red flag,” he recalled."],["p","Burnett excelled at the casting equation to the point where, on Season 2 of “Survivor,” which was shot in the Australian outback, his castaways spent so much time gossiping about the characters from the ",["em","previous"]," season that Burnett warned them, “The more time you spend talking about the first ‘Survivor,’ the less time you will have on television.” But Burnett’s real genius was in marketing. When he made the rounds in L.A. to pitch “Survivor,” he vowed that it would become a cultural phenomenon, and he presented executives with a mock issue of ",["em","Newsweek"]," featuring the show on the cover. (Later, “Survivor” did make the cover of the magazine.) Burnett devised a dizzying array of lucrative product-integration deals. In the first season, one of the teams won a care package that was attached to a parachute bearing the red-and-white logo of Target."],["p","“I looked on ‘Survivor’ as much as a marketing vehicle as a television show,” Burnett once explained. He was creating an immersive, cinematic entertainment—and he was known for lush production values, and for paying handsomely to retain top producers and editors—but he was anything but precious about his art. Long before he met Trump, Burnett had developed a Panglossian confidence in the power of branding. “I believe we’re going to see something like the Microsoft Grand Canyon National Park,” he told the

weeks before the 2016 election, Burnett, in a smart tux with a shawl collar, arrived with his third wife, the actress and producer Roma Downey, at the Microsoft Theatre, in Los Angeles, for the Emmy Awards. Both “Shark Tank” and “The Voice” won awards that night. But his triumphant evening was marred when the master of ceremonies, Jimmy Kimmel, took an unexpected turn during his opening monologue. “Television brings people together, but television can also tear us apart,” Kimmel mused. “I mean, if it wasn’t for television, would Donald Trump be running for President?” In the crowd, there was laughter. “Many have asked, ‘Who is to blame for Donald Trump?’ ” Kimmel continued. “I’ll tell you who, because he’s sitting right there. ",["em","That"]," guy.” Kimmel pointed into the audience, and the live feed cut to a closeup of Burnett, whose expression resolved itself into a rigid grin. “Thanks to Mark Burnett, we don’t have to watch reality shows anymore, because we’re living in one,” Kimmel said. Burnett was still smiling, but Kimmel wasn’t. He went on, “I’m going on the record right now. He’s responsible. If Donald Trump gets elected and he builds that wall, the first person we’re throwing over it is Mark Burnett. The tribe has spoken.”"],["p","Around this time, Burnett stopped giving interviews about Trump or “The Apprentice.” He continues to speak to the press to promote his shows, but he declined an interview with me. Before Trump’s Presidential run, however, Burnett told and retold the story of how the show originated. When he met Trump at Wollman Rink, Burnett told him an anecdote about how, as a young man selling T-shirts on the boardwalk on Venice Beach, he had been handed a copy of “The Art of the Deal,” by a passing rollerblader. Burnett said that he had read it, and that it had changed his life; he thought, What a legend this guy Trump is!"],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5c1af294397f5b30646cf0d9%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225c1af294397f5b30646cf0d9%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F5c1af294397f5b30646cf0d9%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5c1af294397f5b30646cf0d9"}]],["p","Anyone else hearing this tale might have found it a bit calculated, if not implausible. Kym Gold, Burnett’s first wife, told me that she has no recollection of him reading Trump’s book in this period. “He liked mystery books,” she said. But when Trump heard the story he was flattered."],["p","Burnett has never liked the phrase “reality television.” For a time, he valiantly campaigned to rebrand his genre “dramality”—“a mixture of drama and reality.” The term never caught on, but it reflected Burnett’s forthright acknowledgment that what he creates is a highly structured, selective, and manipulated rendition of reality. Burnett has often boasted that, for each televised hour of “The Apprentice,” his crews shot as many as three hundred hours of footage. The real alchemy of reality television is the editing—sifting through a compost heap of clips and piecing together an absorbing story. Jonathon Braun, an editor who started working with Burnett on “Survivor” and then worked on the first six seasons of “The Apprentice,” told me, “You don’t make anything up. But you accentuate things that you see as themes.” He readily conceded how distorting this process can be. Much of reality TV consists of reaction shots: one participant says something outrageous, and the camera cuts away to another participant rolling her eyes. Often, Braun said, editors lift an eye roll from an entirely different part of the conversation."],["p","“The Apprentice” was built around a weekly series of business challenges. At the end of each episode, Trump determined which competitor should be “fired.” But, as Braun explained, Trump was frequently unprepared for these sessions, with little grasp of who had performed well. Sometimes a candidate distinguished herself during the contest only to get fired, on a whim, by Trump. When this happened, Braun said, the editors were often obliged to “reverse engineer” the episode, scouring hundreds of hours of footage to emphasize the few moments when the exemplary candidate might have slipped up, in an attempt to assemble an artificial version of history in which Trump’s shoot-from-the-hip decision made sense. During the making of “The Apprentice,” Burnett conceded that the stories were constructed in this way, saying, “We know each week who has been fired, and, therefore, you’re editing in reverse.” Braun noted that President Trump’s staff seems to have been similarly forced to learn the art of retroactive narrative construction, adding, “I find it strangely validating to hear that they’re doing the same thing in the White House.”"],["p","Such sleight of hand is the industry standard in reality television. But the entire premise of “The Apprentice” was also something of a con. When Trump and Burnett told the story of their partnership, both suggested that Trump was initially wary of committing to a TV show, because he was so busy running his flourishing real-estate empire. During a 2004 panel at the Museum of Television and Radio, in Los Angeles, Trump claimed that “every network” had tried to get him to do a reality show, but he wasn’t interested: “I don’t want to have cameras all over my office, dealing with contractors, politicians, mobsters, and everyone else I have to deal with in my business. You know, mobsters don’t like, as they’re talking to me, having cameras all over the room. It would play well on television, but it doesn’t play well with them.”"],["p","“The Apprentice” portrayed Trump not as a skeezy hustler who huddles with local mobsters but as a plutocrat with impeccable business instincts and unparalleled wealth—a titan who always seemed to be climbing out of helicopters or into limousines. “Most of us knew he was a fake,” Braun told me. “He had just gone through I don’t know how many bankruptcies. But we made him out to be the most important person in the world. It was like making the court jester the king.” Bill Pruitt, another producer, recalled, “We walked through the offices and saw chipped furniture. We saw a crumbling empire at every turn. Our job was to make it seem otherwise.���"],["p","Trump maximized his profits from the start. When producers were searching for office space in which to stage the show, he vetoed every suggestion, then mentioned that he had an empty floor available in Trump Tower, which he could lease at a reasonable price. (After becoming President, he offered a similar arrangement to the Secret Service.) When the production staff tried to furnish the space, they found that local venders, stiffed by Trump in the past, refused to do business with them."],["p","More than two hundred thousand people applied for one of the sixteen spots on Season 1, and throughout the show’s early years the candidates were conspicuously credentialled and impressive. Officially, the grand prize was what the show described as “the dream job of a lifetime”—the unfathomable privilege of being mentored by Donald Trump while working as a junior executive at the Trump Organization. All the candidates paid lip service to the notion that Trump was a peerless businessman, but not all of them believed it. A standout contestant in Season 1 was Kwame Jackson, a young African-American man with an M.B.A. from Harvard, who had worked at Goldman Sachs. Jackson told me that he did the show not out of any desire for Trump’s tutelage but because he regarded the prospect of a nationally televised business competition as “a great platform” for career advancement. “At Goldman, I was in private-wealth management, so Trump was not, by any stretch, the most financially successful person I’d ever met or managed,” Jackson told me. He was quietly amused when other contestants swooned over Trump’s deal-making prowess or his elevated tastes—when they exclaimed, on tours of tacky Trump properties, “Oh, my God, this is so rich—this is, like, ",["em","really"]," rich!” Fran Lebowitz once remarked that Trump is “a poor person’s idea of a rich person,” and Jackson was struck, when the show aired, by the extent to which Americans fell for the ruse. “Main Street America saw all those glittery things, the helicopter and the gold-plated sinks, and saw the most successful person in the universe,” he recalled. “The people I knew in the world of high finance understood that it was all a joke.”"],["p","This is an oddly common refrain among people who were involved in “The Apprentice”: that the show was camp, and that the image of Trump as an avatar of prosperity was delivered with a wink. Somehow, this interpretation eluded the audience. Jonathon Braun marvelled, “People started taking it seriously!”"],["p","When I watched several dozen episodes of the show recently, I saw no hint of deliberate irony. Admittedly, it is laughable to hear the candidates, at a fancy meal, talk about watching Trump for cues on which utensil they should use for each course, as if he were Emily Post. But the show’s reverence for its pugnacious host, however credulous it might seem now, comes across as sincere."],["p","Did Burnett believe what he was selling? Or was Trump another two-dollar T-shirt that he pawned off for eighteen? It’s difficult to say. One person who has collaborated with Burnett likened him to Harold Hill, the travelling fraudster in “The Music Man,” saying, “There’s always an angle with Mark. He’s all about selling.” Burnett is fluent in the jargon of self-help, and he has published two memoirs, both written with Bill O’Reilly’s ghostwriter, which double as manuals on how to get rich. One of them, titled “Jump In!: Even if You Don’t Know How to Swim,” now reads like an inadvertent metaphor for the Trump Presidency. “Don’t waste time on overpreparation,” the book advises."],["p","At the 2004 panel, Burnett made it clear that, with “The Apprentice,” he was selling an archetype. “Donald is the real current-day version of a tycoon,” he said. “Donald will say whatever Donald wants to say. He takes no prisoners. If you’re Donald’s friend, he’ll defend you all day long. If you’re not, he’s going to kill you. And that’s very American. It’s like the guys who built the West.” Like Trump, Burnett seemed to have both a jaundiced impression of the gullible essence of the American people and a brazen enthusiasm for how to exploit it. “The Apprentice” was about “what makes America great,” Burnett said. “Everybody wants one of a few things in this country. They’re willing to pay to lose weight. They’re willing to pay to grow hair. They’re willing to pay to have sex. And they’re willing to pay to learn how to get rich.”"],["p","At the start of “The Apprentice,” Burnett’s intention may have been to tell a more honest story, one that acknowledged Trump’s many stumbles. Burnett surely recognized that Trump was at a low point, but, according to Walker, “Mark sensed Trump’s potential for a comeback.” Indeed, in a voice-over introduction in the show’s pilot, Trump conceded a degree of weakness that feels shockingly self-aware when you listen to it today: “I was seriously in trouble. I was billions of dollars in debt. But I fought back, and I won, big league.”"],["p","The show was an instant hit, and Trump’s public image, and the man himself, began to change. Not long after the première, Trump suggested in an ",["em","Esquire"]," article that people now liked him, “whereas before, they viewed me as a bit of an ogre.” Jim Dowd, Trump’s former publicist, told Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher, the authors of the 2016 book “Trump Revealed,” that after “The Apprentice” began airing “people on the street embraced him.” Dowd noted, “All of a sudden, there was none of the old mocking,” adding, “He was a hero.” Dowd, who died in 2016, pinpointed the public’s embrace of “The Apprentice” as “the bridge” to Trump’s Presidential run."],["p","The show’s camera operators often shot Trump from low angles, as you would a basketball pro, or Mt. Rushmore. Trump loomed over the viewer, his face in a jowly glower, his hair darker than it is now, the metallic auburn of a new penny. (“Apprentice” employees were instructed not to fiddle with Trump’s hair, which he dyed and styled himself.) Trump’s entrances were choreographed for maximum impact, and often set to a moody accompaniment of synthesized drums and cymbals. The “boardroom”—a stage set where Trump determined which candidate should be fired—had the menacing gloom of a “Godfather” movie. In one scene, Trump ushered contestants through his rococo Trump Tower aerie, and said, “I show this apartment to very few people. Presidents. Kings.” In the tabloid ecosystem in which he had long languished, Trump was always Donald, or the Donald. On “The Apprentice,” he finally became Mr. Trump."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3E%E2%80%9CWe%20have%20to%20subscribe%20to%20our%20own%20myths%2C%E2%80%9D%20the%20%E2%80%9CApprentice%E2%80%9D%20producer%20Bill%20Pruitt%20told%20me.%20%E2%80%9CMark%20Burnett%20is%20a%20great%20mythmaker.%20He%20blew%20up%20that%20balloon%20and%20he%20%3Cem%3Ebelieved%3C%2Fem%3E%20in%20it.%E2%80%9D%20Burnett%2C%20preferring%20to%20spend%20time%20pitching%20new%20ideas%20for%20shows%2C%20delegated%20most%20of%20the%20daily%20decisions%20about%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Apprentice%E2%80%9D%20to%20his%20team%2C%20many%20of%20them%20veterans%20of%20%E2%80%9CSurvivor%E2%80%9D%20and%20%E2%80%9CEco-Challenge.%E2%80%9D%20But%20he%20furiously%20promoted%20the%20show%2C%20often%20with%20Trump%20at%20his%20side.%20According%20to%20many%20of%20Burnett%E2%80%99s%20collaborators%2C%20one%20of%20his%20greatest%20skills%20is%20his%20handling%20of%20talent%E2%80%94understanding%20their%20desires%20and%20anxieties%2C%20making%20them%20feel%20protected%20and%20secure.%20On%20interview%20tours%20with%20Trump%2C%20Burnett%20exhibited%20the%20studied%20instincts%20of%20a%20veteran%20producer%3A%20anytime%20the%20spotlight%20strayed%20in%20his%20direction%2C%20he%20subtly%20redirected%20it%20at%20Trump.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EBurnett%2C%20who%20was%20forty-three%20when%20Season%201%20aired%2C%20described%20the%20fifty-seven-year-old%20Trump%20as%20his%20%E2%80%9Csoul%20mate.%E2%80%9D%20He%20expressed%20astonishment%20at%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9Claser-like%20focus%20and%20retention.%E2%80%9D%20He%20delivered%20flattery%20in%20the%20ostentatiously%20obsequious%20register%20that%20Trump%20prefers.%20Burnett%20said%20he%20hoped%20that%20he%20might%20someday%20rise%20to%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9Clevel%E2%80%9D%20of%20prestige%20and%20success%2C%20adding%2C%20%E2%80%9CI%20don%E2%80%99t%20know%20if%20I%E2%80%99ll%20ever%20make%20it.%20But%20you%20know%20something%3F%20If%20you%E2%80%99re%20not%20shooting%20for%20the%20stars%2C%20you%E2%80%99re%20not%20shooting!%E2%80%9D%20On%20one%20occasion%2C%20Trump%20invited%20Burnett%20to%20dinner%20at%20his%20Trump%20Tower%20apartment%3B%20Burnett%20had%20anticipated%20an%20elegant%20meal%2C%20and%2C%20according%20to%20an%20associate%2C%20concealed%20his%20surprise%20when%20Trump%20handed%20him%20a%20burger%20from%20McDonald%E2%80%99s.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3ETrump%20liked%20to%20suggest%20that%20he%20and%20Burnett%20had%20come%20up%20with%20the%20show%20%E2%80%9Ctogether%E2%80%9D%3B%20Burnett%20never%20corrected%20him.%20When%20Carolyn%20Kepcher%2C%20a%20Trump%20Organization%20executive%20who%20appeared%20alongside%20Trump%20in%20early%20seasons%20of%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Apprentice%2C%E2%80%9D%20seemed%20to%20be%20courting%20her%20own%20celebrity%2C%20Trump%20fired%20her%20and%20gave%20on-air%20roles%20to%20three%20of%20his%20children%2C%20Ivanka%2C%20Donald%2C%20Jr.%2C%20and%20Eric.%20Burnett%20grasped%20that%20the%20best%20way%20to%20keep%20Trump%20satisfied%20was%20to%20insure%20that%20he%20never%20felt%20upstaged.%20%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s%20Batman%20and%20Robin%2C%20and%20I%E2%80%99m%20clearly%20Robin%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22callout%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522callout%2522%252C%2522name%2522%253A%2522feature-small%2522%252C%2522body%2522%253A%2522%253Cinline-embed%2520type%253D%255C%2522image%255C%2522%2520meta%253D%255C%2522%25257B%252522type%252522%25253A%252522image%252522%25252C%252522url%252522%25253A%252522%25252Fphotos%25252F5c1ad8e1666e913f4c43d7ad%252522%25252C%252522width%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522height%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522caption%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25257D%255C%2522%2520ref%253D%255C%25225c1ad8e1666e913f4c43d7ad%255C%2522%253E%253C%252Finline-embed%253E%2522%252C%2522attrs%2522%253A%257B%257D%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22%5C%22%3E%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5c1ad8e1666e913f4c43d7ad%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225c1ad8e1666e913f4c43d7ad%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%3Cp%3EBurnett%20sometimes%20went%20so%20far%20as%20to%20imply%20that%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20involvement%20in%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Apprentice%E2%80%9D%20was%20a%20form%20of%20altruism.%20%E2%80%9CThis%20is%20Donald%20Trump%20giving%20back%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20told%20the%20%3Cem%3ETimes%3C%2Fem%3E%20in%202003%2C%20then%20offered%20a%20vague%20invocation%20of%20post-9%2F11%20civic%20duty%3A%20%E2%80%9CWhat%20makes%20the%20world%20a%20safe%20place%20right%20now%3F%20I%20think%20it%E2%80%99s%20American%20dollars%2C%20which%20come%20from%20taxes%2C%20which%20come%20because%20of%20Donald%20Trump.%E2%80%9D%20Trump%20himself%20had%20been%20candid%20about%20his%20reasons%20for%20doing%20the%20show.%20%E2%

He blew up that balloon and he ",["em","believed"]," in it.” Burnett, preferring to spend time pitching new ideas for shows, delegated most of the daily decisions about “The Apprentice” to his team, many of them veterans of “Survivor” and “Eco-Challenge.” But he furiously promoted the show, often with Trump at his side. According to many of Burnett’s collaborators, one of his greatest skills is his handling of talent—understanding their desires and anxieties, making them feel protected and secure. On interview tours with Trump, Burnett exhibited the studied instincts of a veteran producer: anytime the spotlight strayed in his direction, he subtly redirected it at Trump."],["p","Burnett, who was forty-three when Season 1 aired, described the fifty-seven-year-old Trump as his “soul mate.” He expressed astonishment at Trump’s “laser-like focus and retention.” He delivered flattery in the ostentatiously obsequious register that Trump prefers. Burnett said he hoped that he might someday rise to Trump’s “level” of prestige and success, adding, “I don’t know if I’ll ever make it. But you know something? If you’re not shooting for the stars, you’re not shooting!” On one occasion, Trump invited Burnett to dinner at his Trump Tower apartment; Burnett had anticipated an elegant meal, and, according to an associate, concealed his surprise when Trump handed him a burger from McDonald’s."],["p","Trump liked to suggest that he and Burnett had come up with the show “together”; Burnett never corrected him. When Carolyn Kepcher, a Trump Organization executive who appeared alongside Trump in early seasons of “The Apprentice,” seemed to be courting her own celebrity, Trump fired her and gave on-air roles to three of his children, Ivanka, Donald, Jr., and Eric. Burnett grasped that the best way to keep Trump satisfied was to insure that he never felt upstaged. “It’s Batman and Robin, and I’m clearly Robin,” he said."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22feature-small%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5c1ad8e1666e913f4c43d7ad%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225c1ad8e1666e913f4c43d7ad%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"image","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22image%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fphotos%2F5c1ad8e1666e913f4c43d7ad%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5c1ad8e1666e913f4c43d7ad"}]],["p","Burnett sometimes went so far as to imply that Trump’s involvement in “The Apprentice” was a form of altruism. “This is Donald Trump giving back,” he told the ",["em","Times"]," in 2003, then offered a vague invocation of post-9/11 civic duty: “What makes the world a safe place right now? I think it’s American dollars, which come from taxes, which come because of Donald Trump.” Trump himself had been candid about his reasons for doing the show. “My jet’s going to be in every episode,” he told Jim Dowd, adding that the production would be “great for my brand.”"],["p","It was. Season 1 of “The Apprentice” flogged one Trump property after another. The contestants stayed at Trump Tower, did events at Trump National Golf Club, sold Trump Ice bottled water. “I’ve always felt that the Trump Taj Mahal should do even better,” Trump announced before sending the contestants off on a challenge to lure gamblers to his Atlantic City casino, which soon went bankrupt. The prize for the winning team was an opportunity to stay and gamble at the Taj, trailed by cameras."],["p","“The Apprentice” was so successful that, by the time the second season launched, Trump’s lacklustre tie-in products were being edged out by blue-chip companies willing to pay handsomely to have their wares featured onscreen. In 2004, Kevin Harris, a producer who helped Burnett secure product-integration deals, sent an e-mail describing a teaser reel of Trump endorsements that would be used to attract clients: “Fast cutting of Donald—‘Crest is the biggest’ ‘I have worn Levis since I was 2’ ‘I love M&Ms’ ‘Unilever is the biggest company in the world’ all with the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"MONEY MONEY MONEY"]," song over the top.”"],["p","Burnett and Trump negotiated with NBC to retain the rights to income derived from product integration, and split the fees. On set, Trump often gloated about this easy money. One producer remembered, “You’d say, ‘Hey, Donald, today we have Pepsi, and they’re paying three million to be in the show,’ and he’d say, ‘That’s great, I just made a million five!’ ”"],["p","Originally, Burnett had planned to cast a different mogul in the role of host each season. But Trump took to his part more nimbly than anyone might have predicted. He wouldn’t read a script—he stumbled over the words and got the enunciation all wrong. But off the cuff he delivered the kind of zesty banter that is the lifeblood of reality television. He barked at one contestant, “Sam, you’re sort of a disaster. Don’t take offense, but everyone hates you.” Katherine Walker told me that producers often struggled to make Trump seem coherent, editing out garbled syntax and malapropisms. “We cleaned it up so that he was his best self,” she said, adding, “I’m sure Donald thinks that he was never edited.” However, she acknowledged, he was a natural for the medium: whereas reality-TV producers generally must amp up personalities and events, to accentuate conflict and conjure intrigue, “we didn’t have to ",["em","change"]," him—he gave us stuff to work with.” Trump improvised the tagline for which “The Apprentice” became famous: “You’re fired.”"],["p","NBC executives were so enamored of their new star that they instructed Burnett and his producers to give Trump more screen time. This is when Trump’s obsession with television ratings took hold. “I didn’t know what demographics ",["em","was"]," four weeks ago,” he told Larry King. “All of a sudden, I heard we were No. 3 in demographics. Last night, we were No. 1 in demographics. And that’s the important rating.” The ratings kept rising, and the first season’s finale was the No. 1 show of the week. For Burnett, Trump’s rehabilitation was a satisfying confirmation of a populist aesthetic. “I like it when critics slam a movie and it does massive box office,” he once said. “I love it.” Whereas

June 26, 2018, the day the Supreme Court upheld President Trump’s travel ban targeting people from several predominantly Muslim countries, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo sent out invitations to an event called a Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom. If Pompeo registered any dissonance between such lofty rhetoric and Administration policies targeting certain religions, he didn’t mention it."],["p","The event took place the next month, at the State Department, in Washington, D.C., and one of the featured speakers was Mark Burnett. In 2004, he had been getting his hair cut at a salon in Malibu when he noticed an attractive woman getting a pedicure. It was Roma Downey, the star of “Touched by an Angel,” a long-running inspirational drama on CBS. They fell in love, and married in 2007; together, they helped rear Burnett’s two sons from his second marriage and Downey’s daughter. Downey, who grew up in a Catholic family in Northern Ireland, is deeply religious, and eventually Burnett, too, reoriented his life around Christianity. “Faith is a major part of our marriage,” Downey said, in 2013, adding, “We pray together.”"],["p","For people who had long known Burnett, it was an unexpected turn. This was a man who had ended his second marriage during a live interview with Howard Stern. To promote “Survivor” in 2002, Burnett called in to Stern’s radio show, and Stern asked casually if he was married. When Burnett hesitated, Stern pounced. “You didn’t survive ",["em","marriage"],"?” he asked. “You don’t want your girlfriend to know you’re married?” As Burnett dissembled, Stern kept prying, and the exchange became excruciating. Finally, Stern asked if Burnett was “a single guy,” and Burnett replied, “You know? Yeah.” This was news to Dianne, Burnett’s wife of a decade. As she subsequently wrote in her memoir, “The 18-to-34 radio demographic knew where my marriage was headed before I did.”"],["p","In 2008, Burnett’s longtime business partner, a lawyer named Conrad Riggs, filed a lawsuit alleging that Burnett had stiffed him to the tune of tens of millions of dollars. According to the lawsuit, the two men had made an agreement before “Survivor” and “The Apprentice” that Riggs would own ten per cent of Burnett’s company. When Riggs got married, someone who attended the ceremony told me, Burnett was his best man, and gave a speech saying that his success would have been impossible without Riggs. Several years later, when Burnett’s company was worth half a billion dollars, he denied having made any agreement. The suit settled out of court. (Riggs declined to comment.)"],["p","Years ago, Burnett told ",["em","Esquire"]," that religion was “a waste of time.” Dianne Burnett told me that when she was married to him he had no interest in faith. “But you know what? People change,” she continued. “So I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt.” When Burnett met Downey, he reinvented himself. Having made a fortune producing television that was often exploitative, he announced that he would now focus exclusively on “family-friendly franchises,” declaring, “You don’t need to be mean to create drama.” Burnett and Downey launched a production company that has specialized in Christian-themed programming, including a hundred-million-dollar remake of “Ben-Hur,” which flopped. Burnett has spoken enthusiastically to colleagues about the role that prayer and religious devotion now play in his life. He and Downey describe themselves as “the noisiest Christians in Hollywood.”"],["p","Kym Gold told me she thinks that Burnett tends to adapt to his current partner. Before he married Gold, who is Jewish, he took a six-week course in Judaism. “I’ve never known Mark to be religious,” Gold observed. But she noted that “people close to him have said, ‘He follows the wind.’ ”"],["p","Rick Warren, the evangelical pastor, is a friend of Burnett’s. “Mark is not at all the person he was a decade ago,” he told me. “Hollywood is built on money, sex, power, and fame. I would say that none of those things are driving forces for him anymore.” Warren assured me, unprompted, that Burnett is sincere in his Christianity—that he is a “genuine believer” who has committed to being an “ambassador” for his faith. Others who know Burnett noted to me that the Christian community is itself a significant viewer demographic. Burnett talks with colleagues about the “faith audience,” and describes the Christian community as “the largest army on earth.” In 2013, he and Downey produced “The Bible,” a History Channel miniseries that, Burnett claims, was watched by a hundred million people. The Good Book, in Burnett’s words, is “the ultimate period piece.”"],["p","At the State Department, Burnett mentioned religious intolerance “throughout the Middle East,” genocide in Darfur, and the persecution of religious minorities in Myanmar. “I’m simply a TV producer,” he said, noting that he was “far less educated” than his audience. But he was good at communicating with the masses, he went on. He explained his formula for storytelling: “K-I-S-S—‘Keep it simple, stupid.’ ” Burnett said that when he and Downey travel, strangers sometimes “ask her to lay her hands upon them,” as if she were actually an angel. This, he confided, is “the power of media.” He suggested that his position in Hollywood gave him some leverage when it came to pressing politicians to do the right thing: “In the end, nobody wants to look bad in the media.” But Burnett did not cite any controversial White House policies that he hoped to change; he didn’t even mention Trump’s name."],["p","Burnett had remained close to the President. At the National Prayer Breakfast in 2017, he introduced Trump, saying that there “has never been a single bad word between us,” and describing their fourteen-year friendship as “one of the greatest relationships of my life.” Over the years, Burnett and Downey have given to Democratic causes, and in 2008 they donated the maximum contribution to Barack Obama’s campaign. But Burnett has never been especially political. One longtime “Apprentice” staff member told me that Burnett did not welcome the idea of losing his star to a Presidential campaign, noting, “Trump running for President cost Mark a lot of money. He made millions on ‘The Apprentice,’ and Trump killed the franchise.”"],["p","By the time Trump announced his campaign, ratings for “The Apprentice” had fallen, and the show had been repackaged as “The Celebrity Apprentice.” The contestants were now D-list celebrities, including Gary Busey, the zonked-out actor, and Gene Simmons, the repellent front man of Kiss. There were the same business challenges and boardroom eliminations, but the stakes felt conspicuously lower. A lot of the drama in the original “Apprentice” had stemmed from the idea that, for aspiring entrepreneurs, competing on the show could be a career-defining opportunity. For the aging, Botoxed cohort on “The Celebrity Apprentice,” their presence was a tacit admission that their best days were behind them. Still, everyone gamely pretended to take it seriously. Describing the show in one public appearance, Donald Trump, Jr., said that it could be intimidating for Trump’s children to pass judgment on someone “as accomplished as a Gene Simmons.”"],["p","In the opening episode of Season 11, the theatrical tension of the boardroom was suddenly punctured by an electronic trill. “Whose cell phone?” Trump growled."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5c1af2938822322ea4b3b530%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225c1af2938822322ea4b3b530%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F5c1af2938822322ea4b3b530%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5c1af2938822322ea4b3b530"}]],["p","“How do I turn this off?” Busey stuttered, fumbling with the tiny buttons."],["p","“Gary, turn your cell phone off!” Trump said.

Like a starlet who keeps returning to a favorite director, Trump had always loved the way that Burnett made him look. Burnett was summoned to New York for a consultation with the President-elect and another Trump confidant, the financier Tom Barrack. Burnett pitched a few Riefenstahlian notions: a parade up Fifth Avenue; a televised helicopter ride ushering Trump from Manhattan to D.C. Barrack, who became the chairman of the inaugural committee, later said that Burnett was actively involved in producing the Inauguration, adding, “Mark is a genius, and the President-elect loves him.”"],["p","I spoke to several people who recalled Burnett telling them that he was busy working on the Inauguration. A Democratic political operative who was involved in a back-channel campaign to dissuade big-name stars from appearing at the event told me that Burnett had tried to enlist musicians to perform. “Mark was somebody we were actively working against,” the operative said. Trump’s wish list included Elton John, Aretha Franklin, and Paul Anka—who, he hoped, would sing “My Way”—but they all claimed to be otherwise engaged. The event ended up with sparse crowds and a feeble roster of performers."],["p","Burnett eventually played down his role in the Inauguration.

October 8, 2016, the day after the Washington ",["em","Post"]," released the “Access Hollywood” tape in which Trump was caught on a hot mike bantering about grabbing women’s crotches, Bill Pruitt tweeted, “As a producer on seasons 1 & 2 of #theapprentice I assure you: when it comes to the #trumptapes there are far worse.” In other interviews, Pruitt said that, during his time on “The Apprentice,” he’d heard Trump make not only sexist statements but also racist ones. This was not so difficult to imagine. Trump’s natural idiom is vulgarity, and the targets of his ire—Colin Kaepernick, “shithole countries,” any African-American journalist who asks him a tough question—are clearly not chosen at random. Part of what was mesmerizing about him, to Mark Burnett and, ultimately, to the American people, was his compulsion for offensive talk."],["p","But, in the heightened political atmosphere of an impending Trump Presidency, the notional existence of more “Trump tapes” assumed a potent urgency. Last summer, Omarosa Manigault Newman, the former “Apprentice” contestant and aide to the President, reignited such speculations when she claimed to have heard a tape, recorded during the period when “The Apprentice” was made, in which Trump said the N-word. Manigault Newman produced a recording of her own, taken surreptitiously, of a conversation with two aides from the Trump campaign, in which they appeared to discuss the existence of such a tape. On the recording, one of the aides, Lynne Patton, says that she raised the issue with Trump, and that he said he had no recollection of using such language. “No, he said it,” Katrina Pierson, the other aide, interjects. “He’s embarrassed.”"],["p","On August 13, 2018, Trump denied that he had ever used racial slurs, tweeting, “@MarkBurnettTV called to say that there are ",["em",{"class":"small"},"NO TAPES"]," of the Apprentice where I used such a terrible and disgusting word as attributed by Wacky and Deranged Omarosa.”"],["p","This was a peculiar thing to tweet: if Trump had never uttered the epithet, why would he need to be assured by Burnett that there were no tapes of him doing so? The tweet was also notable because, when the “Access Hollywood” tape leaked, Burnett had taken his most definitive step toward distancing himself from Trump. In a statement, he had said, “Given all of the false media reports, I feel compelled to clarify a few points. I am not now and have never been a supporter of Donald Trump’s candidacy. I am ",["em",{"class":"small"},"NOT"]," ‘Pro-Trump.’ Further, my wife and I reject the hatred, division and misogyny that has been a very unfortunate part of his campaign.”"],["p","Trump generally answers such criticism with a hyperventilating rebuttal, but he didn’t fire back at Burnett—at least not publicly—and their friendship does not appear to have suffered. Scarcely two months after issuing his statement about not being “Pro-Trump,” Burnett attended a fund-raiser for the President-elect at Cipriani, in New York, and in January, 2017, he and his two sons flew to Washington for the Inauguration. Burnett may have wanted to downplay his friendship with the President, but Trump felt no similar compunction. Last March, at a rally in Richfield, Ohio, he announced, “I got a call from Mark Burnett! He did ‘The Apprentice,’ he’s a great guy. He said, ‘Donald, I called just to say hello and to tell you, did you see Roseanne’s ratings?’ ” (Roseanne Barr, a rare Trump supporter in Hollywood, had just rebooted her sitcom.) “I said, ‘Mark, how big were they?’ ‘They were unbelievable! Over eighteen million people!’ ” When I asked Burnett’s representatives about the President’s characterizations of his exchanges with Burnett, they declined to either confirm or deny their accuracy."],["p","Burnett’s reluctance to discuss the Trump Presidency is dismaying to many people involved with “The Apprentice,” given that Trump has succeeded in politics, in part, by borrowing the tropes of the show. Jonathon Braun pointed out to me that when Trump announced his candidacy, in 2015, he did so in the atrium of Trump Tower, and made his entrance by descending the gold-colored escalator—choreography that Burnett and his team had repeatedly used on the show. After Trump’s announcement, reports suggested that people who had filled the space and cheered during his speech had been hired to do so, like TV extras, for a day rate of fifty dollars. Earlier this year, the White House started issuing brief video monologues from the President that strongly evoke his appearances on Burnett’s show. Justin McConney, a former director of new media for the Trump Organization, told ",["em","New York"]," that, whenever Trump works with camera people, he instructs them, “Shoot me like I’m shot on ‘The Apprentice.’ ”"]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3ERandal%20Pinkett%2C%20who%20won%20Season%204%20of%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Apprentice%2C%E2%80%9D%20told%20me%20that%20he%20had%20watched%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20campaign%20with%20a%20growing%20sense%20of%20dread.%20Pinkett%20had%20long%20since%20concluded%20that%20Trump%20was%20racist.%20When%20Trump%20named%20Pinkett%2C%20who%20is%20African-American%2C%20the%20winner%2C%20he%20asked%20him%20if%20he%20would%20consider%20sharing%20the%20title%20with%20another%20contestant%2C%20a%20white%20woman.%20Pinkett%20declined.%20%E2%80%9CThe%20only%20conclusion%20I%20can%20draw%20is%20that%20he%20didn%E2%80%99t%20want%20to%20see%20a%20black%20man%20be%20the%20sole%20winner%20of%20his%20show%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20told%20me.%20In%20a%20recent%20interview%20with%20%3Cem%3EVanity%20Fair%3C%2Fem%3E%2C%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20former%20lawyer%20Michael%20Cohen%20said%20Trump%20told%20him%20that%20he%20had%20not%20chosen%20Kwame%20Jackson%2C%20the%20Goldman%20Sachs%20banker%2C%20to%20win%20in%20Season%201%2C%20because%20%E2%80%9Cthere%E2%80%99s%20no%20way%20I%20can%20let%20this%20black%20fag%20win.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EAs%20a%20winner%2C%20Pinkett%20went%20to%20work%20for%20the%20Trump%20Organization.%20%E2%80%9CThe%20closer%20I%20got%20to%20Donald%2C%20the%20less%20I%20liked%20what%20I%20saw%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20recalled.%20%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s%20like%20a%20person%20with%20bad%20breath.%E2%80%9D%20After%20Pennsylvania%20legalized%20casino%20gambling%2C%20in%202004%2C%20Trump%20applied%20for%20a%20license%20to%20build%20a%20casino%20in%20a%20predominantly%20African-American%20community.%20%E2%80%9CThe%20community%20%3Cem%3Ehated%3C%2Fem%3E%20Donald%2C%E2%80%9D%20Pinkett%20said.%20So%20the%20company%20dispatched%20Pinkett%20as%20an%20advocate.%20Upon%20returning%2C%20he%20said%2C%20%E2%80%9CI%E2%80%99m%20not%20going%20out%20there%20again%20to%20represent%20you%20folks.%E2%80%9D%20The%20Trump%20Organization%20was%20using%20him%20like%20a%20prop%2C%20he%20felt%2C%20and%20he%20did%20not%20want%20to%20sell%20a%20project%20that%20the%20community%20so%20roundly%20opposed.%20The%20casino%20was%20never%20built.%20Even%20the%20grand%20prize%20on%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Apprentice%E2%80%9D%20was%20a%20bit%20of%20a%20fake%2C%20Pinkett%20told%20me.%20His%20Trump%20Organization%20job%20was%20actually%20paid%20for%20by%20NBC.%20%E2%80%9CIt%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20even%20his%20money!%E2%80%9D%20he%20said.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EWhen%20Trump%20announced%20his%20campaign%2C%20Pinkett%20and%20Kwame%20Jackson%20decided%20to%20make%20a%20public%20statement%20opposing%20him.%20%E2%80%9CThis%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20about%20policy%20or%20politics%2C%20this%20was%20about%20fitness%20for%20office%2C%E2%80%9D%20Jackson%20recalled.%20%E2%80%9CThis%20was%20about%20basic%20American%20character%20and%20decency.%E2%80%9D%20They%20reached%20out%20to%20scores%20of%20former%20contestants%20and%20planned%20a%20press%20conference.%20In%20the%20end%2C%20apart%20from%20Pinkett%2C%20Jackson%2C%20and%20two%20other%20contestants%2C%20nobody%20showed%20up.%20In%20a%20statement%2C%20Trump%20said%2C%20%E2%80%9CHow%20quickly%20they%20forget.%20Nobody%20would%20know%20who%20they%20are%20if%20it%20weren%E2%80%99t%20for%20me.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3E%E2%80%9CI%20think%20the%20reality%20for%20Mark%20Burnett%20is%20he%E2%80%99s%20a%20Hollywood%20guy%2C%E2%80%9D%20Jackson%20told%20me.%20%E2%80%9CHe%20probably%20feels%20that%20if%20he%20torpedoes%20Donald%20Trump%20he%E2%80%99ll%20torpedo%20a%20part%20of%20his%20own%20legacy.%20And%20it%E2%80%99s%20funny%2C%20because%20he%20has%20enough%20money%20and%20enough%20power%20in%20Hollywood%20that%20he%20%3Cem%3Ecould%3C%2Fem%3E%20actually%20afford%20to%20speak%20up.%E2%80%9D%20Burnett%E2%80%99s%20silence%20%E2%80%9Cis%20abdication%2C%E2%80%9D%20Jackson%20said.%20%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s%20collusion.%20It%E2%80%99s%20being%20complicit%2C%20just%20like%20an%20Ivanka%20Trump.%20I%E2%80%99m%20very%20disappointed%20in%20Mark%20for%20that.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","Randal Pinkett, who won Season 4 of “The Apprentice,” told me that he had watched Trump’s campaign with a growing sense of dread. Pinkett had long since concluded that Trump was racist. When Trump named Pinkett, who is African-American, the winner, he asked him if he would consider sharing the title with another contestant, a white woman. Pinkett declined. “The only conclusion I can draw is that he didn’t want to see a black man be the sole winner of his show,” he told me. In a recent interview with ",["em","Vanity Fair"],", Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen said Trump told him that he had not chosen Kwame Jackson, the Goldman Sachs banker, to win in Season 1, because “there’s no way I can let this black fag win.”"],["p","As a winner, Pinkett went to work for the Trump Organization. “The closer I got to Donald, the less I liked what I saw,” he recalled. “It’s like a person with bad breath.” After Pennsylvania legalized casino gambling, in 2004, Trump applied for a license to build a casino in a predominantly African-American community. “The community ",["em","hated"]," Donald,” Pinkett said. So the company dispatched Pinkett as an advocate. Upon returning, he said, “I’m not going out there again to represent you folks.” The Trump Organization was using him like a prop, he felt, and he did not want to sell a project that the community so roundly opposed. The casino was never built. Even the grand prize on “The Apprentice” was a bit of a fake, Pinkett told me. His Trump Organization job was actually paid for by NBC. “It wasn’t even his money!” he said."],["p","When Trump announced his campaign, Pinkett and Kwame Jackson decided to make a public statement opposing him. “This wasn’t about policy or politics, this was about fitness for office,” Jackson recalled. “This was about basic American character and decency.” They reached out to scores of former contestants and planned a press conference. In the end, apart from Pinkett, Jackson, and two other contestants, nobody showed up. In a statement, Trump said, “How quickly they forget. Nobody would know who they are if it weren’t for me.”"],["p","“I think the reality for Mark Burnett is he’s a Hollywood guy,” Jackson told me. “He probably feels that if he torpedoes Donald Trump he’ll torpedo a part of his own legacy. And it’s funny, because he has enough money and enough power in Hollywood that he ",["em","could"]," actually afford to speak up.” Burnett’s silence “is abdication,” Jackson said. “It’s collusion. It’s being complicit, just like an Ivanka Trump.

recent piece in the Ankler, a widely read online newsletter about Hollywood, noted that Burnett “has spent the past couple years reigning over his corner of resistance territory with nary the

to work with Mark Burnett.

Barber, a former accountant, had brought the studio back from bankruptcy, slashing costs and shepherding profitable titles like the James Bond franchise. In his effort to build up M-G-M, Barber wanted to augment the studio’s television business. So he bought Burnett’s company and enlisted him to oversee television production."],["p","Ostensibly, Barber and Burnett got along. But, whereas Mark Burnett Productions had been characterized by profligate dazzle, Barber was thrifty, and monitored every expense. The chairman of M-G-M’s board is Kevin Ulrich, a financier whose private-equity fund holds a controlling stake in the company. People who know Ulrich describe him as someone who relishes the flashy perquisites of Hollywood moguldom. Whereas Barber liked to spend weekends quietly tending to the racehorses he owns, Ulrich liked going to parties and premières."],["p","Barber was interested in selling the studio—a move that Ulrich opposed. According to several sources, Burnett began cultivating Ulrich, inviting him to events and introducing him to celebrities. Then, last March, M-G-M’s board informed Barber that he had been fired; he had just signed a contract extension, so the studio would pay him two hundred and sixty million dollars to leave. Despite this payment, he was incensed. Three months after Barber’s ouster, Burnett was promoted to chairman of television at M-G-M. Barber declined to speak with me, but a friend of his said that he was “blindsided” by his ouster: Burnett had made an alliance with Ulrich and got Barber kicked off the island."],["p","As a younger man, Burnett made it known that he wasn’t content to be the producer of a few hit shows—he wanted to run a television studio one day. According to someone who has worked closely with him, Burnett had always felt like an outsider, “because in the reality-TV business, you’re never part of the true Hollywood.” He had long aspired to transition to scripted television and films but did not have much talent for such storytelling. At M-G-M, he would oversee both scripted and unscripted shows, including the acclaimed series “Fargo” and “The Handmaid’s Tale.”"],["p","He had now achieved such a level of power that, even in reflexively liberal Hollywood, his association with Trump was discussed mostly in whispers. Many people who spoke to me for this piece would not do so on the record, citing fears of being blacklisted. Nevertheless, “The Apprentice” continues to dog Burnett. In 2017, when he took the stage at the Producers Guild of America Awards to accept the award for Outstanding Producer of Competition Television, there were boos in the audience. In September, he skipped the Emmy Awards, though “The Voice” and “Shark Tank” were nominated; the night before the ceremony, however, he and Downey attended the annual gala for the Motion Picture & Television Fund, at a hotel in Century City. Walking into the event, they had a confrontation with the actor Tom Arnold."],["p","Arnold, a wild-eyed industry veteran best known for his role in the 1994 film “True Lies” and for a former marriage to Roseanne Barr, had been on a quest to uncover damaging “Apprentice” outtakes of Donald Trump. He had even launched a gonzo TV show, produced by Vice, called “The Hunt for the Trump Tapes.” As Arnold relates on the show, he and Trump knew each other for years, because they had occupied “the same level of Hollywood.” Indeed, in 2010, Burnett had e-mailed Arnold, “Is there any way I can get you to do Celeb Apprentice? . . . I do think that Celeb Apprentice has an awesome brand. Trump really wants you. I ",["em",{"class":"small"},"REALLY"]," want you.” Arnold was, in his own estimation, a prankster and a marginal celebrity. And it disturbed him to think that someone just like him might be entrusted with managing the country."],["p","What precisely happened in Century City is a matter of dispute, but there was a scuffle between Arnold and Burnett. Soon afterward, Roma Downey tweeted a photograph of the back of her hand, writing, “Got this bruise tonight when Tom Arnold tried to ambush my husband Mark and me at a charity event. Is your TV show worth it Tom? Please stop.” Some observers wondered whether a bruise could have emerged that quickly. Arnold himself offered a very different account on Twitter: “Mark Burnett just went apeshit & choked me at this huge Emmy party then he ran away with his torn Pink shirt & missing gold chain. I’m waiting for LAPD.”"],["p","It might seem improbable that Burnett, the smiling glad-hander, would physically attack someone. But it would not be unprecedented. His second wife, Dianne Burnett, told me that one day, in Santa Monica, Mark left her and one of their sons in the car in order to fetch frozen yogurt. While he was gone, a vagrant began aggressively banging on the car window, presumably in search of a donation. When Burnett returned, Dianne recalled, he punched the man in the face, knocking him down, then drove away."],["p","Hours after the Century City event, TMZ published an account by an eyewitness, who said that “Mark had his hands on Tom’s throat, and Tom was tearing at Mark’s shirt and ripping off his crucifix.” The authorities have declined to press charges against Burnett, and several people close to him characterized Arnold as a puerile stunt artist who cornered Burnett in a bit of performance art in order to promote his lousy show."],["p","That may well be true, but there is a certain cosmic poetry in the notion that the only person in Hollywood willing to antagonize Burnett about his relationship with Trump is a figure like Tom Arnold. Someone who has worked with Burnett told me, “Mark created the ",["em","world"]," in which Tom Arnold is the only guy who can go after him. Tom Arnold is trolling Mark Burnett just like Donald Trump trolled all his opponents. And he’s doing it for a reality show!”"]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EAfter%20Season%201%20of%20%E2%80%9CSurvivor%2C%E2%80%9D%20a%20contestant%20named%20Stacey%20Stillman%20sued%20CBS%20and%20Burnett%2C%20claiming%20that%20he%20had%20improperly%20shaped%20the%20competition%20by%20whispering%20to%20contestants%20about%20whom%20they%20should%20vote%20to%20eliminate.%20In%20a%20deposition%2C%20another%20cast%20member%20said%20that%20Burnett%20%E2%80%9Cbelieved%20that%20certain%20people%20would%20make%20a%20better%20TV%20show%20than%20others%2C%20and%20he%20did%20what%20he%20could%20to%20have%20influence%20over%20those%20people%20staying%20on%20the%20island.%E2%80%9D%20Burnett%20denied%20any%20wrongdoing%2C%20and%20the%20suit%20was%20ultimately%20settled.%20One%20consequence%20of%20the%20lawsuit%20was%20that%2C%20when%20it%20came%20time%20to%20make%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Apprentice%2C%E2%80%9D%20producers%20tried%20to%20have%20cameras%20on%20Donald%20Trump%20from%20the%20moment%20he%20walked%20onto%20the%20set%20until%20the%20moment%20he%20left%E2%80%94and%20all%20that%20footage%20was%20preserved.%20When%20M-G-M%20bought%20Burnett%E2%80%99s%20company%2C%20it%20assumed%20ownership%20of%20those%20outtakes%20and%2C%20after%20the%20%E2%80%9CAccess%20Hollywood%E2%80%9D%20tape%20leaked%2C%20it%20had%20to%20contend%20with%20public%20demands%20to%20unseal%20the%20%E2%80%9CApprentice%E2%80%9D%20tapes.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EMarvin%20Putnam%2C%20a%20lawyer%20who%20represents%20M-G-M%2C%20told%20me%2C%20%E2%80%9CMark%20Burnett%20cannot%20release%20the%20tapes.%20Period.%20Even%20if%20Mark%20Burnett%20%3Cem%3Ewanted%3C%2Fem%3E%20to%20release%20the%20tapes%2C%20Mark%20Burnett%20cannot%20release%20the%20tapes.%E2%80%9D%20Putnam%20explained%20that%20the%20contracts%20that%20Trump%20and%20other%20cast%20members%20signed%20contained%20standard%20industry%20stipulations%20limiting%20the%20manner%20in%20which%20outtakes%20and%20other%20footage%20could%20be%20used.%20These%20are%20binding%20obligations%2C%20which%20means%20that%20if%20M-G-M%20were%20to%20violate%20them%E2%80%94by%20releasing%20footage%20not%20just%20of%20Trump%20but%20of%20anyone%20who%20appeared%20with%20him%20onscreen%E2%80%94the%20studio%20could%20be%20sued.%20Brian%20Edwards%2C%20the%20president%20of%20television%20operations%20at%20M-G-M%2C%20who%20has%20worked%20with%20Burnett%20for%20more%20than%20a%20decade%2C%20pointed%20out%20that%2C%20even%20without%20such%20legal%20constraints%2C%20Burnett%20couldn%E2%80%99t%20release%20the%20tapes%E2%80%94if%20he%20did%2C%20talent%20would%20refuse%20to%20work%20with%20him%20in%20the%20future.%20%E2%80%9CIf%20everybody%20in%20reality%20television%20knew%20that%20their%20outtakes%20were%20going%20to%20be%20made%20public%20at%20the%20first%20sign%20of%20pressure%2C%20what%20do%20you%20think%20would%20happen%20to%20the%20business%3F%E2%80%9D%20Edwards%20asked.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3ENeither%20Putnam%20nor%20Edwards%20would%20comment%20on%20whether%20M-G-M%20possesses%20tapes%20in%20which%20Trump%20says%20something%20offensive%3B%20nor%20would%20they%20say%20how%20much%2C%20if%20any%2C%20of%20the%20archive%20has%20been%20reviewed.%20Over%20the%20fourteen%20seasons%20hosted%20by%20Trump%2C%20nearly%20two%20hundred%20hours%20of%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Apprentice%E2%80%9D%20aired%20on%20NBC.%20If%20Burnett%20indeed%20shot%20three%20hundred%20hours%20of%20footage%20for%20each%20episode%2C%20there%20could%20be%20some%20sixty%20thousand%20hours%20of%20outtakes%20to%20sift%20through.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EMost%20of%20the%20former%20%E2%80%9CApprentice%E2%80%9D%20staffers%20I%20spoke%20to%20recalled%20hearing%20Trump%20speak%20coarsely%20about%20women.%20%E2%80%9CHe%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20going%20around%20saying%20%E2%80%98pussy%2C%20pussy%2C%20pussy%E2%80%99%20all%20the%20time%2C%E2%80%9D%20Walker%20said.%20But%20he%20regularly%20made%20comments%20about%20the%20bodies%20of%20female%20contestants%20and%20female%20staffers.%20One%20%E2%80%9CApprentice%E2%80%9D%20employee%20told%20me%2C%20%E2%80%9CHe%E2%80%99d%20say%2C%20%E2%80%98How%20about%20those%20boobs%3F%20Wouldn%E2%80%99t%20you%20like%20to%20fuck%20her%3F%E2%80%99%C2%A0%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EEven%20so%2C%20Braun%20said%20he%20doubted%20that%20there%20was%20any%20%E2%80%9CApprentice%E2%80%9D%20tape%20in%20which%20Trump%20uses%20the%20N-word.%20%E2%80%9CI%20was%20the%20supervising%20editor%20on%20the%20first%20six%20seasons%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said.%20%E2%80%9CI%20didn%E2%80%99t%20watch%20every%20frame%2C%20but%20in%20everything%20I%20saw%20I%20didn%E2%80%99t%20hear%20him%20saying%20anything%20so%20horrible.%E2%80%9D%20Braun%20noted%20that%20editors%20on%20reality%20shows%20often%20amuse%20themselves%20by%20compiling%20%E2%80%9Cgag%E2%80%9D%20reels%20of%20a%20cast%20member%E2%80%99s%20most%20off-color%20or%20embarrassing%20moments.%20The%20producers%20may%20be%20barred%2C%20legally%2C%20from%20airing%20such%20outtakes%2C%20but%20that%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20stop%2

Season 1 of “Survivor,” a contestant named Stacey Stillman sued CBS and Burnett, claiming that he had improperly shaped the competition by whispering to contestants about whom they should vote to eliminate. In a deposition, another cast member said that Burnett “believed that certain people would make a better TV show than others, and he did what he could to have influence over those people staying on the island.” Burnett denied any wrongdoing, and the suit was ultimately settled. One consequence of the lawsuit was that, when it came time to make “The Apprentice,” producers tried to have cameras on Donald Trump from the moment he walked onto the set until the moment he left—and all that footage was preserved. When M-G-M bought Burnett’s company, it assumed ownership of those outtakes and, after the “Access Hollywood” tape leaked, it had to contend with public demands to unseal the “Apprentice” tapes."],["p","Marvin Putnam, a lawyer who represents M-G-M, told me, “Mark Burnett cannot release the tapes. Period. Even if Mark Burnett ",["em","wanted"]," to release the tapes, Mark Burnett cannot release the tapes.” Putnam explained that the contracts that Trump and other cast members signed contained standard industry stipulations limiting the manner in which outtakes and other footage could be used. These are binding obligations, which means that if M-G-M were to violate them—by releasing footage not just of Trump but of anyone who appeared with him onscreen—the studio could be sued. Brian Edwards, the president of television operations at M-G-M, who has worked with Burnett for more than a decade, pointed out that, even without such legal constraints, Burnett couldn’t release the tapes—if he did, talent would refuse to work with him in the future. “If everybody in reality television knew that their outtakes were going to be made public at the first sign of pressure, what do you think would happen to the business?” Edwards asked."],["p","Neither Putnam nor Edwards would comment on whether M-G-M possesses tapes in which Trump says something offensive; nor would they say how much, if any, of the archive has been reviewed. Over the fourteen seasons hosted by Trump, nearly two hundred hours of “The Apprentice” aired on NBC. If Burnett indeed shot three hundred hours of footage for each episode, there could be some sixty thousand hours of outtakes to sift through."],["p","Most of the former “Apprentice” staffers I spoke to recalled hearing Trump speak coarsely about women. “He wasn’t going around saying ‘pussy, pussy, pussy’ all the time,” Walker said. But he regularly made comments about the bodies of female contestants and female staffers. One “Apprentice” employee told me, “He’d say, ‘How about those boobs? Wouldn’t you like to fuck her?’ ”"],["p","Even so, Braun said he doubted that there was any “Apprentice” tape in which Trump uses the N-word. “I was the supervising editor on the first six seasons,” he said. “I didn’t watch every frame, but in everything I saw I didn’t hear him saying anything so horrible.” Braun noted that editors on reality shows often amuse themselves by compiling “gag” reels of a cast member’s most off-color or embarrassing moments. The producers may be barred, legally, from airing such outtakes, but that doesn’t stop editors from sharing them internally. Tom Arnold told me that he has seen one such reel from “The Apprentice,” in which Trump uses the N-word. But Braun, who is dismayed that Trump is President, is dubious. “If there ",["em","was"]," a tape, it would have spread like wildfire,” he said. Another “Apprentice” staffer made the same point: “If somebody had the goods, it would have leaked long ago. There were no Trump fans on the set. I don’t know a single person who worked on the show who voted for Trump.”"],["p","Whenever Trump appeared on the show, the staffer explained, there were “at least a hundred people watching him,” with a dozen cameras capturing every angle. Live feeds were transmitted to executives not just at NBC but at corporations sponsoring the episode. The staffer continued, “In the ‘Access Hollywood’ tape, Donald was on a bus. He thought he was alone. He never thought he was alone in the boardroom. It was a ",["em","set"],".”"],["p","To Braun, the hunt for the tapes feels like a distraction. “We’ve seen that it doesn’t matter,” he said. “He now says plenty of things that are ",["em","outwardly"]," racist, misogynist, and fascist.

day this past fall, Burnett got a call from his first wife, Kym Gold, with whom he remains friendly. Gold was upset about what was happening in the country, and asked Burnett to intervene with Trump. “We had it out,” she told me. “I said, ‘You’ve got to help our children, for the future and safety of this country.’ ” Gold implored Burnett, “Tell him this is not a reality show. This is real life. You’re the President. You’re saying things you cannot say—to reporters, to other world leaders.”"],["p","Burnett heard her out. “I’m not into politics,” he told her. “I’m not even on Twitter.” But he said that he had no intention of speaking out against Trump or of releasing any tapes. “I’m just a guy who produces shows,” he insisted."],["p","Burnett may not be a policy maven, but he has long been fascinated with political star power. In 2010, he launched “Sarah Palin’s Alaska,” on TLC, announcing, “With a dynamic personality that has captivated millions, I can’t think of anyone more compelling than Sarah Palin to tell the story of Alaska.” At the time, Burnett contended that the show was “completely nonpolitical.” The Daily Beast disagreed, suggesting that it “may qualify as the earliest, most expensive Presidential campaign ad ever made.”"],["p","Burnett and Trump have licensed the “Apprentice” format to dozens of other countries, and Burnett once noted that, increasingly, tycoons cast in the Trump role are “people with political aspirations.” At least half a dozen hosts have held political office, including João Doria, the governor-elect of São Paulo State, who is an ally of Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s strongman President-elect. Last year, Kevin O’Leary, one of the hosts of “Shark Tank,” announced his intention of running for Prime Minister of Canada, as a member of the Conservative Party, noting that he and Trump had “both worked for Mark Burnett, and we both got famous on reality television.” Burnett joked to more than one person that he was no longer simply a TV producer but a producer of political leaders. (Four months later, O’Leary dropped out of the race and returned to the show.)"],["p","For nearly two decades, Burnett has also spoken about his desire to make a television show with Vladimir Putin. In 2001, he sought to enlist Putin in a project called “Destination: Mir,” a reality competition in which the winner would be sent into space. The idea was scuttled after Russia decommissioned the Mir space station. In 2015, Burnett expressed an interest in building a reality show featuring Putin—not so much a program about politics, Burnett suggested, as a hymn to the glory of Russia, “the humans, the nature, the animals of the nation.”"],["p","Burnett’s myopia about politics may be selective, but that does not mean it is feigned. He would hardly be the first Hollywood chieftain with a dim grasp of current events beyond Los Angeles, but even by industry standards he can seem remarkably disconnected. Shortly after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland, Florida, this past February, Burnett attended a regular meeting of television executives at M-G-M. At one point, someone mentioned the marketing plan for a project in the studio’s film division: a remake of “Death Wish,” starring Bruce Willis. The movie, about an armed vigilante, was unabashedly pro-gun—Breitbart eventually hailed it as an “N.R.A. Public Service Announcement.” Someone asked whether M-G-M would be altering the rollout of the film, in light of the shooting."],["p","“What shooting?” Burnett said, according to someone outside M-G-M who was briefed on the meeting. When his incredulous colleagues wondered how he could not have been aware of the Parkland massacre, Burnett said, “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” adding, “I’m not on social media.”"],["p","For all Burnett’s talk about being nonpolitical, his reluctance to disavow the President may stem, in part, from a fear of alienating Trump’s constituents. Like Republican lawmakers or evangelical pastors, Burnett is beholden to a faction of the public that, in many instances, thinks the President can do no wrong. “The moment you go political, you turn half of the nation against you,” Rick Warren told me. “And, when you’re trying to reach as many people as you can, you don’t want to do that.” The dilemma is compounded, Warren pointed out, when the occupant of the White House is so vindictive. “You know the way this President chews up people?” Warren said. “There’s a fine line in what you can say.”"],["p","Katherine Walker suggested that part of the reason Burnett seems so unfazed by the role he has played in the Trump saga may be that he is British. “There is something to being American and having these visceral reactions that Mark doesn’t have,” she said. “He just doesn’t get it on that level. I don’t think he has the same sense of Oh, my God, what have I done?” For many Americans, the Trump Presidency evokes a painful feeling of dispossession, as cherished norms and national institutions are eviscerated. “People are making it seem like Mark’s ignoring evil,” Walker continued. “But I think it’s more benign than that—and scarier, in a way.

is extremely smart,” Richard Levak, the psychologist who consulted for Burnett on “The Apprentice,” told me. “Mark has an eye for casting, and he cast Donald Trump.” I asked Levak what kind of personality profile he might have prepared for Trump as a candidate for the show. He said he would have noted “the energy, the impulsiveness, the inability to articulate a complete thought because he gets interrupted by emotions, so when he speaks it’s all adjectives—‘great,’ ‘huge,’ ‘horrible.’ ” What made Trump so magnetic as a reality-television star was his impulse to transgress, Levak continued, and it is the same quality that has made a captive audience of the world. “That somebody can become that successful while also being that emotionally undisciplined—it’s so macabre that you ",["em","have"]," to watch it,” he said. “And you keep waiting for the comeuppance. But it doesn’t come.”"],["p","There has likely never been a man who, in his own lifetime, has been as widely spoken and written about as Donald Trump. Politics has never been so spellbinding. “It’s the reason people watch a schoolyard fight,” Levak said. “It’s vicariously watching someone act out and get away with it.” Burnett once remarked that “Lord of the Flies” is so absorbing because all the characters are suddenly transported into a world in which “the rules are changed, and convention, law, and morality are suspended.” It’s an apt paraphrase of the Trump Presidency."],["p","On Sunday afternoons, Burnett likes to pour himself a generous glass of wine and stroll out onto the balcony of his seven-thousand-square-foot home, off the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu. He and Downey refer to the property, which was undamaged by the recent wildfires, as the Sanctuary. It is an exquisite spot, with white couches facing an unbroken view of the ocean. Burnett likes to reflect on the fact that his mansion is not far from one of the homes where, as a young immigrant, he worked as a nanny. He ",["em","is"]," on social media, as it happens. He seldom tweets, but he’s active on Instagram. Along with family snapshots and photographs of Burnett palling around with celebrities and religious figures, there are a couple of videos he has taken of himself relaxing on the balcony."],["p","“Lazy Sunday afternoon,” Burnett says in one of them. He is barefoot, wearing a T-shirt that says “",["em",{"class":"small"},"SPIRITUAL GANGSTER"],".” He gestures at his expansive view, with undisguised satisfaction, and says, “Look at this. Wow.” He pans the camera across the sky, which is just starting to bruise red and violet in the twilight. “So grateful,” Burnett says. He often expresses wonderment at how blessed he is, and at the magnitude of his success—which, these days, he ascribes to “God’s favor.”"],["p","When I remarked to Jonathon Braun that Burnett seems eerily untroubled by the legacy of his own creation, he said that, for Burnett, the Presidency was just another game. He went on, “I think it’s a game for Trump, too. It’s a game for the audience. I think the voters like it. They’re enjoying the spectacle. It’s in the soul of who Mark is. They’re kindred spirits. There are no major causes driving them—it’s just about playing a game and winning it.”"],["p","Years ago, when Burnett did publicity for “Survivor,” interviewers tried to figure out how the contestants had fared that season. Of course, he could not reveal such secrets. So when they asked Burnett who would win the game, he told them, “Me.” ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"590a18798b51cf59fc42477f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"590a18798b51cf59fc42477f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Profiles","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"profiles"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"Profiles","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"profiles"}]}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Patrick Radden Keefe","type":"author","title":"Patrick Radden Keefe, a staff writer, has been contributing to The New Yorker since 2006.

first room of “Epic Abstraction: Pollock to Herrera,” a wishfully canon-expanding show of painting and sculpture from the past eight decades, at the Metropolitan Museum, affects like a mighty organ chord. It contains the museum’s two best paintings by Jackson Pollock: “Pasiphaë” (1943), a quaking compaction of mythological elements named for the accursed mother of the Minotaur, and “Autumn Rhythm (Number 30)” (1950), a singing orchestration of drips in black, white, brown, and teal enamel—bluntly material and, inextricably, sublime. There are six Pollock drawings, too, and “Number 7” (1952), one of his late, return-to-figuration paintings in mostly black on white, of an indistinct but hieratic head. The adjective “epic” does little enough to honor Pollock’s mid-century glory, which anchors the standard art-historical saga of Abstract Expressionism—“The Triumph of American Painting,” per the title of a 1976 book on the subject by Irving Sandler—as a revolution that stole the former thunder of Paris and set a stratospheric benchmark for subsequent artists.

This made me a bit nervous—I was weaned on Abstract Expressionism—but I was also game, as one must be now, for democratizing revisions of art history. I need not have fretted—or hoped. The show, curated by Randall Griffey, takes the old valuation as a given without mentioning its vulnerabilities: rhetorical inflation, often, and macho entitlement, always. (Zooming in on the dazzling annals of the movement’s historic struggles, you discover tacky barroom cockfights.)

Why and how did the prestige of Abstract Expressionism collapse at the end of the nineteen-fifties? Ignored entirely are movements—French ",["em","tachisme"],", Northern European ",["em",{"class":"small"},"COBRA"],"—that contested New York supremacy at the time and seem ripe, now, for reconsideration.

It consists of frenzied smearings, by hands and feet, of oils in browns and reds. It is dramatic as a deed but, as a painting, slack, with no formal tension. The paint just sits there: evidence rather than expression. In this context, the work suggests a misunderstanding of the firmly disciplined Pollock as a wild man. Shiraga comes off as a callow provincial. That’s unfair. He and his peers in the Gutai group meaningfully responded to the disarray of their nation after the disasters of the Second World War. These artists weren’t concerned with either the epic or, although their work was nonfigurative, the abstract in any pointed way, and pitting the Shiraga against masterpieces that supremely embody both feels beyond maladroit: cruel. One of the show’s verbose wall texts acknowledges the stylistic and historical character of the Gutai group, but being told what to think hardly balances what one is given to see."],["p","The show’s oppressive effect intensifies in its magnificent second room, which gathers ten works by Mark Rothko that vary widely in quality but feature a gem in plangent red-orange and an ungraspable cream color, “No. 3,” from 1953, his peak year of aesthetic miracles. This hammers home the majesty of the New York School—and almost exhausts, by the way, the major strength of the Met’s holdings of art since the nineteen-forties. (But for a few loans, the show draws on the museum’s collection.)

There are excellent sculptures by Isamu Noguchi and David Smith, and sculptures that make no sense at all, in this context, by Alexander Calder, Jean Tinguely, and, at the show’s entrance, Dan Flavin. Several good-to-O.K. works by Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, and Franz Kline maintain the main line of Abstract Expressionism, from which paintings by Ellsworth Kelly and Cy Twombly sharply, but without affirmed notice, depart. Some later artists revive keynotes of the epoch—Joan Snyder with a lively smatter of drifting brushwork, from 1971, and, recently, Mark Bradford with grand splurges of jittery marks—at a cost of inviting comparison with their powerful precedents. “Mrs. N’s Palace” (1964-77), by the sometimes winning sculptor Louise Nevelson, goes all in for Abstract Expressionism’s tendency toward grandiosity. Crowding the middle of the show, it’s a hut—or perhaps a shrine—made of black-painted wood scraps, almost twelve feet high, nearly twenty feet wide, and fifteen feet deep. Beyond the staggering first impression that it makes, the work affords next to no visual engagement. A fussily decorative painting on four panels, “La Vie en Rose” (1979), likewise betrays Joan Mitchell. You wouldn’t guess from it, if you didn’t already know, that Mitchell is easily the premier second-generation Abstract Expressionist, and the most reliably thrilling."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22feature-small%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5c1d1b603e17f81da2a3b6be%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225c1d1b603e17f81da2a3b6be%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"image","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22image%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fphotos%2F5c1d1b603e17f81da2a3b6be%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5c1d1b603e17f81da2a3b6be"}]],["p","Were this a more thoughtful show, it would not have installed “New York #2,” by Hedda Sterne (the only woman in the famous 1951 ",["em","Life"]," group photograph of the era’s new artists), so inconspicuously, or “Red Roses Sonata” (1972), by Alma Thomas, the once neglected but increasingly celebrated Washington, D.C., color-field painter. Sterne’s work is a tall, abstracted cityscape in grisaille that looks, from a distance, drawn or somehow printed but, up close, reveals itself to be tenderly brushed. One could argue that it’s an important dissent from the prevailing art of its time. Thomas’s painting, justifying its title, is a truly musical composition of red and green strokes. She was an astonishing colorist, more than equal in that respect to others in her stylistic cohort, like Helen Frankenthaler, Morris Louis, and Kenneth Noland, who are also represented in the show.

Herrera’s eponymous presence is a gesture broadcasting the show’s character as an exercise in feel-good inclusion—the museum congratulating itself on liberal virtuousness, with its responsibility to draw distinctions of quality and significance politely on hold.

and Alexandra Chau got married in 2012, when they were twenty-eight years old. Mike works in tech, Alex in finance. As they thought about expanding their family, they moved from Manhattan to Mike’s childhood neighborhood of Forest Hills, Queens. An enthusiastic eater, Mike considered himself “one of those people who posted too many pictures of food” on Instagram. One night in 2013, he took a picture of a newborn baby, red and scowling, alongside an open takeout container of chicken and brown rice: the Chaus’ son, Matty, was sixty-seven hours old."],["p","A meatball shot followed. Then red velvet cake. Then, as the days passed, sushi and pad Thai. Matty was not yet consuming solid food, but his newborn expressions—lolling tongue, grimace—seemed to convey a gastronomic opinion. When paired with a cider doughnut, he rolled his eyes, as if in disdain. His father discovered that a bitten cookie resembled a bib when held beneath his son’s chin. The food was a fun accessory to the baby—or was it the other way around? “I thought, Oh, this is interesting,” Mike said."],["p","The star power of the Instagram feed that became @foodbabyny doubled in 2015, when the Chaus’ daughter, Sammy, was born. She made her social-media début with a box of pastries from the Doughnut Project. Mike liked visiting buzzy new restaurants on opening day, and, as the children grew, so did @foodbabyny’s repertoire. The kids posed with pizza, tofu, kimchi, kale, bagels, burgers, spring rolls, shakshuka, crêpes, noodles, ramen, falafel, waffles, bao, and pie. They were caught sleeping, laughing, thumbs-upping, pouting, and squalling, often while wearing entertaining outfits—a trucker cap that said “",["em",{"class":"small"},"RIBS"],",” a T-shirt that said “",["em",{"class":"small"},"NEW YORK OR NOWHERE"],".”"],["p","Mike name-checked businesses with a friendly hashtag (#foodbabylovesottostacos), which endeared him to restaurateurs. Foodies began asking him where to eat. He disliked the term “influencer,” but that’s what he became. Inevitably, there was backlash: after Sammy was shown shredding an enormous leg of turkey at Disneyland, a commenter complained, “You’re literally giving SHIT to your kid.” Mike later said, “Just because the kids are ",["em","next"]," to the food doesn’t mean they’re eating all of it.”"],["p","By the time the Hester Street Fair asked Mike to curate the inaugural FoodBabyNY Food Fest, this past October, more than three hundred thousand Instagrammers were following the Chaus. On a cold, blustery day, hundreds of them showed up on the Lower East Side, to sample the food of some two dozen venders in white tents. Mike stood by a Chau-family tent, receiving visitors. The “baby” portion of @foodbabyny was temporarily unavailable: Alex had taken Matty, now five, to warm up in the car, and Sammy, three, had taken refuge behind a vender’s table, where she was snuggling in her grandfather’s lap."],["p","Looking around at the offerings—Supermoon Bakehouse, Destination Dumplings, Mama’s Too!—Mike noted that he’d chosen restaurants that deserved “more exposure.” He was holding yuca fries from Millie’s Cuban Café, but so many people were trying to talk to him that he didn’t have time to eat. Do all your posts involve your kids? (Most do, yes!) Where’s a good place around here for brunch? (Kiki’s!) Can we get a picture? (Absolutely!) After getting her selfie, Janice Wang, a young foodie from the Upper East Side, said, “I’m a bit of a food snob, and I want to know what’s out there.” Diana Nguyen and Cham Keat, who run the Instagram account @hypefoodies, had driven from Washington, D.C. Nguyen was holding an Ice & Vice cone piled with scoops of Pickled Cherry and FoodBaby, a special flavor (Concord-grape ice cream, raspberry coulis, doughnut soil, rainbow sprinkles). Of the Chaus, Nguyen said, “We really love watching them live their life with food.”"],["p","Kevin Hernandez, a guidance counsellor, introduced Mike to his wife, Ilana, who was pregnant. “We’re obsessed with you guys,” Hernandez told him. “We love that your kids eat whatever you give them.”"],["p","“Did you see the video of us giving them grasshoppers?” Mike said."],["p","“It was amazing,” Hernandez said. “They were eating them like they were chips.”"],["p","After a teen-age boy asked Mike for advice on breaking out of an Instagram rut—“I feel like everything is starting to look the same”—Sammy wandered out, wearing a leopard-print jacket and sparkly pink sneakers. The crowd swarmed, cell phones aloft. A woman said to her husband, “Oh, there’s the little girl!”"],["p","Will @foodbabyny lose its appeal as the children grow up? The question is irrelevant, for now. A couple of weeks after the festival, Alex gave birth to a daughter, Nicky—Chau baby No. 3. Within weeks, Nicky was rolling her eyes on Instagram, backdropping a Gooey Everything Bar from the Good Batch. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"5c1d36046e94e940914671c9","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c1d36046e94e940914671c9","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Influencers","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"influencers"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"Influencers","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"influencers"}]}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Paige Williams","type":"author","title":"Paige Williams, the Laventhol/Newsday Visiting Professor at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism, became a staff writer at \u003cem>The New Yorker\u003c/em> in 2015.","email":"","bio":["div",["p","Paige Williams began writing for ",["em","The New Yorker"]," in 2013 and became a staff writer in 2015.

discontent.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","It seems only proper that when Laurel met Hardy for the first time, on film, the meeting should have been not face to face but butt to butt. In “The Lucky Dog,” released in 1921, Oliver Hardy, in the role of a thief who has just grabbed a fistful of cash at gunpoint, tucks it into the back pocket of his pants; or, rather, by mistake, into the pants of a complete stranger, played by Stan Laurel, who is bending over and facing the other way. For a moment, they’re together, cheek to cheek, and, as with all good slapstick, the motion is hard to describe but easy to watch. Their personae are not yet fixed (Hardy, though heavy, is far too poised a gent to be ",["em","a"]," heavy), and their joint career has yet to bloom, but already they seem bound to the principle that human error, in its infinite variety, is the most natural thing in the world. We should feel disappointed when things go right."],["p","Some of that fluency lingers in “Stan & Ollie,” a new film about Laurel and Hardy, written by Jeff Pope and directed by Jon S. Baird. For reasons that I fail to grasp, the movie skips over the high noon of the couple’s fame—which ran roughly from the late nineteen-twenties to the outbreak of war, though diehard devotees would stretch it out longer—and chooses to focus, instead, on its plaintive dusk. The bulk of the story is set in the years 1953-54, as Laurel (Steve Coogan) and Hardy (John C. Reilly) travel around Britain, rehashing their old routines in a stage show. The plan is to end the tour triumphantly in London, and to secure financing for a Robin Hood movie, entitled “Rob ’Em Good.” We know, as Laurel knows, that it may never get made, yet still he sits at his typewriter, in rented rooms, tapping out dialogue and dreaming up fresh follies for him and his partner to enact. They may have been two peas in a pod, but, as everybody in the business was aware, if you wanted to thrash out the details of the pod’s adventures, Stan was the man."],["p","The plot of “Stan & Ollie” is so slight as to be spoiler-proof. Though the tour goes feebly at first, it gathers strength once the boys agree to publicity appearances, on the advice of the British impresario Bernard Delfont—smoothly played by Rufus Jones, with an indestructible grin and the charm applied like hair oil. Other major events include the arrival of Lucille (Shirley Henderson), the third Mrs. Hardy, and Ida (Nina Arianda), the fourth Mrs. Laurel, who spar a little, but not much. Our heroes, likewise, get into an argument, at a reception held in their honor, whereupon, in the movie’s happiest touch, the guests around them politely applaud, unable to imagine that the contretemps is anything but an act. Later, of course, Laurel and Hardy patch it up. Ollie gets sick at a beauty pageant, but he survives. And that’s it."],["p","The film depends, in other words, on its stars. Both, you can tell, have studied their respective masters with scrupulous care, and the results of their pupillage are plain to see. Coogan does ample justice to Stan’s eyebrows, which, in their rise and fall, are a more sensitive guide to the utterness of his bewilderment than the celebrated scratching of his scalp. Reilly, for his part, is sweetly attuned to the music of Ollie’s fatalism—less in his line readings, or in the occasional songs, than in the symphony of sighs with which he greets the inevitable wrecking of his peace. As for the grace notes of his grunts, has anyone packed more meaning into a single “Hmph”? (Marlon Brando, an admirer, said that what he liked best was Ollie “doing dead takes into the camera and shaking his head.”) The fact that Laurel and Hardy remained a joy to witness, for so long, is extraordinary, given that what they explored, with inordinate patience, was the largely joyless theme of resignation. Look at the downturned mouth of the big guy and the weakling’s helpless burst of tears. Hark to the slump of their inseparable souls."],["p","In 1955, Kenneth Tynan reviewed the London première of “Waiting for Godot” and proposed that Laurel and Hardy would be “ideal casting” as Lucky and Pozzo. But those two are slave and master, closer to the discomforting duo of Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet, whereas Stan and Ollie, despite their physical differences, are interlocked, for all eternity, like Vladimir and Estragon. There’s a hint of that purgatory in Baird’s film, as the two legends find themselves repeating the same setups, over and over, to half-empty halls. More than once, for instance, we watch Laurel shell and eat a hard-boiled egg beside Hardy’s hospital bed, reaching into a breast pocket for a convenient salt shaker and exasperating the patient. Though Coogan has the gestures down pat, you really need to see the egg in its rightful place—in “County Hospital” (1932), where Stan’s visit hatches a furor of unintended chaos that ends outside, on the streets of Los Angeles, with his automobile almost split in half. Laurel and Hardy’s gags, viewed in isolation, rarely amount to much; they turn funny only when one gag falls on the heels of another, and the canter of mishaps becomes impossible to stop."],["p","Nothing is more well worn, among theatrical tropes, than the pathos of the faded clown. (Chaplin’s “Limelight” relies on little else.) If the fading is to hit home, though, you need to remember the glory that blazed before, and what’s at stake, in “Stan & Ollie,” is not how loudly purists will object to its inaccuracies but how many Laurel and Hardy fans, even of the impure kind, still exist, and whether any new ones will arise as a result. In addition, Stan and Ollie were, by all accounts, decent folk, industrious in their craft, courteous to their supporters, and especially appealing to children, who relished the revelation that adults could be idiots, too. So, where’s the mystery?"],["p","In Chaplin’s case, there will always be plenty to unearth, such was the monstrous majesty of his egotism; Buster Keaton grows ever more unfathomable; but “Stan & Ollie” delves in search of hidden wellsprings that aren’t there. “You loved Laurel and Hardy, but you never loved me,” Ollie says to his partner, at one point, yet the complaint doesn’t really ring true. If it means anything, it means simply that both of them were pros. That is why their pairing, more fusion than double act, has endured as a byword for togetherness. Even if you’ve never seen a minute of their movies, and even though the two men spend most of those movies squabbling and getting on each other’s nerves, you sense that Stan and Ollie wouldn’t have it any other way. They swelter in the summer of their discontent."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EThe%20first%20shot%20of%20Nicole%20Kidman%2C%20in%20%E2%80%9CDestroyer%2C%E2%80%9D%20is%20a%20closeup%20of%20her%20eyes.%20Bleary%20and%20darkly%20ringed%2C%20they%20make%20you%20wonder%20what%20horrors%20they%20have%20seen.%20The%20rest%20of%20her%20is%20barely%20in%20better%20shape.%20Her%20walk%20is%20a%20staggering%20shuffle%2C%20and%20her%20face%20is%20so%20lined%20that%20the%20marketing%20department%20at%20Neutrogena%2C%20for%20whom%20Kidman%20has%20fronted%20eager%20commercials%20(%E2%80%9CWrinkles%2C%20your%20time%20is%20up!%E2%80%9D)%2C%20may%20conceivably%20launch%20a%20legal%20challenge%20to%20have%20the%20movie%20banned.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EShe%20plays%20Erin%20Bell%2C%20a%20detective%20in%20the%20L.A.P.D.%2C%20and%20clearly%20the%20lonest%20of%20wolves.%20Despite%20having%20a%20sidekick%2C%20Antonio%20(Shamier%20Anderson)%2C%20she%20spurns%20his%20assistance.%20At%20the%20start%20of%20Karyn%20Kusama%E2%80%99s%20movie%2C%20Erin%20inspects%20a%20corpse.%20Three%20roundels%20are%20tattooed%20on%20its%20nape%3B%20beside%20it%20lie%20a%20hundred-dollar%20bill%2C%20stained%20with%20purple%20dye%2C%20and%20a%20%E2%80%9Cghost%20gun%2C%E2%80%9D%20shorn%20of%20identifying%20marks.%20All%20of%20which%20is%20evidence%2C%20apparently%2C%20that%20someone%20named%20Silas%20(Toby%20Kebbell)%2C%20a%20fearsome%20figure%20from%20Erin%E2%80%99s%20past%2C%20is%20back%20in%20the%20criminal%20game.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3ENow%20and%20then%2C%20we%20get%20flashbacks%20to%20that%20past%E2%80%94to%20a%20period%20when%20Erin%20and%20a%20colleague%2C%20Chris%20(Sebastian%20Stan)%2C%20went%20undercover%20with%20Silas%20and%20his%20gang%2C%20who%20were%20carrying%20out%20armed%20robberies.%20If%20you%E2%80%99re%20slow%2C%20like%20me%2C%20and%20find%20yourself%20bemused%20by%20the%20chronology%2C%20don%E2%80%99t%20worry%3B%20your%20reward%20will%20be%20a%20topnotch%20twist%20toward%20the%20end.%20By%20rights%2C%20that%20should%20make%20you%20want%20to%20watch%20the%20movie%20all%20over%20again%2C%20in%20order%20to%20sort%20out%20what%20belongs%20where%2C%20except%20that%20everything%20about%20it%20is%20so%20scummy%E2%80%94even%20the%20sight%20of%20creamer%20being%20stirred%20into%20coffee%20makes%20you%20gag%E2%80%94that%20a%20second%20viewing%20would%20feel%20like%20the%20grimmest%20of%20grinds.%20%E2%80%9CDestroyer%E2%80%9D%20is%20a%20thriller%2C%20but%20only%20just.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EKidman%20is%20indeed%20remarkable%20here%2C%20as%20rumor%20suggests%2C%20but%20mainly%20because%20you%20can%E2%80%99t%20stop%20remarking%20her.%20It%E2%80%99s%20an%20over-cover%20performance%20in%20an%20undercover%20role.%20Though%20aiming%20to%20blend%20in%2C%20she%E2%80%99s%20so%20dramatically%20busy%20that%20she%20ends%20up%20sticking%20out%2C%20like%20a%20chameleon%20who%E2%80%99s%20praying%20for%20an%20Oscar%20nod.%20The%20rule%20seems%20to%20be%20that%20the%20more%20makeup%20and%20prosthetics%20she%20piles%20on%20the%20more%20likely%20we%20are%20to%20cry%20out%2C%20in%20unison%2C%20%E2%80%9COh%2C%20look%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20Nicole%20Kidman!%E2%80%9D%20Still%2C%20to%20be%20fair%2C%20she%20does%20lunge%20without%20demur%20into%20the%20action%2C%20toting%20an%20automatic%20rifle%20sufficiently%20massive%20to%20foil%20a%20bank%20job.%20I%20don%E2%80%99t%20%3Cem%3Ethink%3C%2Fem%3E%20that%20Kidman%20did%20that%20when%20she%20played%20Virginia%20Woolf%2C%20in%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Hours%E2%80%9D%20(2002)%2C%20but%20I%20can%E2%80%99t%20help%20wishing%20she%20had.%C2%A0%E2%99%A6%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","The first shot of Nicole Kidman, in “Destroyer,” is a closeup of her eyes. Bleary and darkly ringed, they make you wonder what horrors they have seen. The rest of her is barely in better shape. Her walk is a staggering shuffle, and her face is so lined that the marketing department at Neutrogena, for whom Kidman has fronted eager commercials (“Wrinkles, your time is up!”), may conceivably launch a legal challenge to have the movie banned."],["p","She plays Erin Bell, a detective in the L.A.P.D., and clearly the lonest of wolves. Despite having a sidekick, Antonio (Shamier Anderson), she spurns his assistance. At the start of Karyn Kusama’s movie, Erin inspects a corpse. Three roundels are tattooed on its nape; beside it lie a hundred-dollar bill, stained with purple dye, and a “ghost gun,” shorn of identifying marks. All of which is evidence, apparently, that someone named Silas (Toby Kebbell), a fearsome figure from Erin’s past, is back in the criminal game."],["p","Now and then, we get flashbacks to that past—to a period when Erin and a colleague, Chris (Sebastian Stan), went undercover with Silas and his gang, who were carrying out armed robberies. If you’re slow, like me, and find yourself bemused by the chronology, don’t worry; your reward will be a topnotch twist toward the end. By rights, that should make you want to watch the movie all over again, in order to sort out what belongs where, except that everything about it is so scummy—even the sight of creamer being stirred into coffee makes you gag—that a second viewing would feel like the grimmest of grinds. “Destroyer” is a thriller, but only just."],["p","Kidman is indeed remarkable here, as rumor suggests, but mainly because you can’t stop remarking her. It’s an over-cover performance in an undercover role. Though aiming to blend in, she’s so dramatically busy that she ends up sticking out, like a chameleon who’s praying for an Oscar nod. The rule seems to be that the more makeup and prosthetics she piles on the more likely we are to cry out, in unison, “Oh, look, it’s Nicole Kidman!” Still, to be fair, she does lunge without demur into the action, toting an automatic rifle sufficiently massive to foil a bank job. I don’t ",["em","think"]," that Kidman did that when she played Virginia Woolf, in “The Hours” (2002), but I can’t help wishing she had. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"59b9bf9c66a5ca32dcef1772","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"59b9bf9c66a5ca32dcef1772","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"The Current Cinema","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"the-current-cinema"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"The Current Cinema","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"the-current-cinema"}]}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Anthony Lane","type":"author","title":"Anthony Lane has been a film critic for \u003cem>The New Yorker\u003c/em> since 1993.

recent morning, as tourists and office workers streamed into and out of the Empire State Building lobby, the arrival of a freshly minted movie star went unnoticed. Yalitza Aparicio plays the lead role in “Roma,” Alfonso Cuarón’s lauded Netflix film, about a live-in housekeeper for a middle-class family in Mexico City; the character, Cleo, is based on Cuarón’s childhood nanny, Libo, to whom the movie is dedicated. When Aparicio got the part, just after completing her degree in preschool education, she had never acted before and had never been outside Mexico. Now she has walked red carpets around the world, appears on the cover of Mexican ",["em","Vogue"],", and is an unlikely awards-season contender in a field that includes Glenn Close, Melissa McCarthy, and Lady Gaga."],["p","But she had never been to the top of the Empire State Building. “I’m going to be able to see the whole city from above,” she said through a translator, Juana Suárez, a film scholar at N.Y.U. Her entourage also included Carlos Torres, the manager of the Mexican actress Marina de Tavira, who plays Cleo’s employer; and Nancy García, Aparicio’s friend from school, who plays her fellow-maid. Both Aparicio, twenty-five, and García, twenty-four, are of Mixtec descent. On the second floor, the group examined a wall with snapshots of famous visitors. Aparicio recognized Susan Sarandon, whom she’d seen at a photo shoot in Toronto."],["p","Two elevators later, they emerged on the eighty-sixth floor, and stepped out onto the observation deck. “I was not expecting it to be so windy,” Aparicio said, her long black hair whipping her face. She and García took a selfie; they were bundled in scarves and winter coats. (García’s had been provided by the film’s producers.) “There it is, the statue,” Aparicio remarked, spotting the Statue of Liberty. Circling north, Suárez pointed out St. Patrick’s Cathedral and the Bronx. “Spanish Harlem is now highly Mexican, but they are leaving because the rents are very high,” she said."],["p","Aparicio nodded. “The last time I was here, the park was still green,” she noted, pointing at a bare-limbed Central Park. (That was in October, for the New York Film Festival.) Torres, who wore a Mickey Mouse sweatshirt, motioned her next to García for a picture. “Two Oaxacan Women Take Manhattan!” he said. A visit to the western edge of the building was short-lived: too windy. The women huddled, laughing. “Now I understand how they did ‘Mary Poppins,’ ” Aparicio said."],["p","Aparicio is from the city of Tlaxiaco, in Oaxaca. She was home from her school in Putla, two hours away, when she heard about the “Roma” auditions from her sister Edith. At first, she was suspicious. “I thought that it could be related to human trafficking, because they never do castings in Oaxaca,” she said. But she accompanied her sister, who was pregnant and got cold feet once they were there. At the first audition, she was asked questions such as “Have you ever been in love?”; the next time, she had to improvise a scene and read a story about a ",["em","torteria"],". After she got the part, she brought in García, her classmate, to help her translate a scene that was written in Mixtec. (Aparicio speaks mostly Spanish.) “Alfonso said it would be great if the person that plays my friend is a real friend,” she said, and so García was cast, too. Aparicio is unsure if she will go back to teaching. “We’ll see what happens.”"],["p","Downstairs in the gift shop, Aparicio considered a snow globe with a King Kong figurine. “It’s thanks to ‘King Kong’ that I was aware this building existed,” she said. García recalled that, at the final dubbing session, “I hugged Alfonso and I told him, ‘I think this is the last time we’ll see each other.’ He said, ‘No, wait—the best part is coming.’ ” Months later, the two women embarked on the film’s promotional blitz: Venice, London, Telluride, Toronto. “We saw a street in San Francisco called Nancy Street,” García, whose parents named her Nancy after seeing the name on television, said with excitement. (She was likely referring to Nancy Pelosi Drive.) They had vowed not to watch the finished film until its première in Venice. “When they turned on the lights, we were crying,” Aparicio said."],["p","Before leaving the gift shop, Aparicio inspected a display of personalized license-plate magnets, alphabetized by first name. “I’m looking for my name,” she said. Victoria . . . William . . . Xavier . . . no Yalitza. Oh, well. She added, “My name means ‘sunrise of life.’ ” ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7c2bfcc72cd92d052c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Yalitza Aparicio","parent":[],"photos":{},"slug":"yalitza-aparicio"},{"id":"5c2e1c7c41e4c73c088d7759","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"“Roma”","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"roma"},{"id":"5c2e1c772bfcc72cd92d051f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Movies","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"movies"},{"id":"5c2e1c78e56e652c90274659","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Actors","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"actors"},{"id":"5c2e1c7a22d4972cd5b83291","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Film","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"film"},{"id":"5c2e1c7c81ab3335f580f16d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Alfonso Cuarón","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"alfonso-cuaron"},{"id":"5c2e1c7c7e716b454591adac","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"category_culture","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"category-culture"},{"id":"5c2e1c7cb75f002c8941e472","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Empire State Building","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"empire-state-building"},{"id":"5c2e1c7ce56e652c90274666","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Actresses","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"actresses"},{"id":"5c2e1c7b36cecf40192141d4","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mexico","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mexico"},{"id":"5c2e1c7936cecf40192141c9","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"New York City","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"new-york-city"}],"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"59113a7276b9ca4b4bbd158c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"59113a7276b9ca4b4bbd158c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"The Pictures","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"the-pictures"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"The Pictures","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"the-pictures"}]}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[{"name":"Yalitza Aparicio","url":"/tag/yalitza-aparicio"},{"name":"“Roma”","url":"/tag/roma"},{"name":"Movies","url":"/tag/movies"},{"name":"Actors","url":"/tag/actors"}],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Michael Schulman","type":"author","title":"Michael Schulman has contributed to The New Yorker since 2006.
